<h1>Why Everything2 failed</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>Before Wikipedia took the crown as the Internet's top
user-editable encyclopaedia, there was Everything2. E2 was flush
with community features, was open to a broader variety of content
than Wikipedia, and had support of then-popular site Slashdot. What
was E2, and why did Wikipedia win?</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>I first encountered Everything2 some time in 2000 or 2001,
before most Internet users had ever heard of Wikipedia. Websites
that other people could edit were still a relatively new
concept, and aside from appointed senior editors, users could
not edit each others' writing.</p>

<p>This restriction may sound harsh, but it gave Everything2
a property that Wikipedia has never had. Since users are
given full responsibility for their own writing, there's no
enforced neutrality. You can find personal anecdotes, opinion
pieces, and humour, as the author wrote it, immune to the meddling
of nitpicking users. Quality control is enforced by a communal
voting system rewarding interesting, not factual content.</p>

<h2>Cream of the Cool</h2>

<p>Everything2's solution to quality control was a roleplaying-game
style experience system. Users are rewarded with "experience points"
for creating content and receiving positive votes. Users received
promotions based on the number of experience points earned and
writeups created, with each level offering increasing power and
responsibility.</p>

<p>At level 2, you gain the privilege of voting on other users,
up to ten articles per day, for which action you too are awarded
experience. Level 4 grants the ability to hand out "Cools", an
award that briefly promotes the article to the front page.
It's much the same model that keeps World of Warcraft running
at ten million players, and it worked to create an average of
around 45,000 writeups per year.</p>

<h2>So why did it fail?</h2>

<p>Ultimately, the drawback to Everything2 was that it was
naturally subtractive. Because users couldn't edit poor
quality work, a bad writeup could only be left bad or deleted.
On Wikipedia, the same content would be gradually improved
by successive users. It doesn't matter if a user gives up
and leaves, because on Wikipedia anyone else can edit his
material.</p>

<p>Senior E2 editors tried to combat this problem with a
mass-deletion of poor quality content, a process titled
"Raising the Bar". Unfortunately, this only discouraged
users, who could return to the site after a hiatus to
discover their material removed and hard-earned experience
points deducted.</p>

<p>Raising the Bar improved quality overall, but did it
so by oligarchy of senior editors, rather than the democratic
system already in place. The real problem was that users
weren't collaborating on content to improve quality of
the existing material, and that's something Wikipedia had
solved much better than Everything2.</p>

<h2>Still Good</h2>

<p>That said, Everything2 today is still home to some
great content. Here's a list of some nodes that I enjoyed;
