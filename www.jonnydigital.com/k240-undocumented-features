<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>Missile damage values</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Explosive:</b> 10 damage. Strikes one square.</li>
  <li><b>Area Explosive:</b> 10 damage. Strikes multiple squares.</li>
  <li><b>Napalm:</b> 14 damage. Can spread to nearby buildings.</li>
  <li><b>Hellfire:</b> 11 damage. Spreads well through densely packed buildings.
      May be able to strike the same building more than once.</li>
  <li><b>Nuclear:</b> 16 damage, 43 damage to four-square buildings. Strikes
      every building on the asteroid, raises radiation, and
      can strike ships in orbit.</li>
  <li><b>Scatter:</b> 10 damage, strikes over a wide area.</li>
  <li><b>Vortex:</b> Random damage of 2, 4 or 6 per hit. Vortex wanders
      randomly, for a random duration, and can split at random.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Nuclear is especially deadly to large buildings, which take
more damage due to their larger area. Its base damage will destroy
all large buildings not protected by Building Armour or a Screen
Generator, and all Living Quarters and Resiblocks (except Protected
Resiblocks). This is how one Nuclear hit destroys an entire colony.</p>

<p>A Nuclear will also destroy all Anti-Missile Pods, Laser Turrets,
and all power generating buildings except Protected Solar Matrix.
This knocks out defences against additional missiles. A second
Nuclear destroys every building except Storage Tower, Environment
Control (and protected equivalents), Power Store, Ore Teleporter
and Screen Generator.</p>

<p>For more on the nuclear missile, see the article on
<a href="k240-nuclear-missile">nuclear missiles</a>.</p>

<h2>Kll-Kp-Qua special missile</h2>

<p>The K240 manual states that the Kll-Kp-Qua "possess a special
type of warhead, but its effects are unknown". According to
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RT6RDBGiQk">Thiima52's
Youtube video</a> demonstrating bugs in the the
<a href="k240-cu-amiga-coverdisk">CU Amiga K240 demo</a>, the
special warhead decreases the population on a planet. It
appears to reduce the population by 20.</p>

<p>The special warhead replaces the Vortex missile for that
alien. It's possible that the special warhead shares the
same attributes as the Vortex missile - cost 9000, requires
3 crystalite.</p>

<h2>Ship hardpoint damage values</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Ion Cannon:</b> 5 damage.</li>
  <li><b>Disruptor:</b> 5 damage. Larger area. Four-square buildings can be
      struck more than once by a Disruptor shot if more than one of
      their squares is hit.</li>
  <li><b>Napalm Orb:</b> Appears to be 14 damage, same as the Napalm
      missile.</li>
  <li><b>Chaos Bomb:</b> Appears to be 11 damage, same as Hellfire. May be
      able to strike the same building more than once.</li>
  <li><b>Vortex Mine:</b> Appears to create the same Vortex as the
      Vortex missile: wanders dealing 2, 4 or 6 damage per hit.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are tested against the Kll'Kp'Qua. It's possible that
races have weakness or resistance against certain weapons.</p>

<p>A brief test against the Kll'Kp'Qua suggests the Laser Cannon
deals 2 damage, the Photon Cannon 4, and the Plasma Cannon 5.
Further tests will be necessary.
</p>

<h2>Building hit points</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>5HP:</b> Landing Pad, Living Quarters, Solar Panel</li>
  <li><b>10HP:</b> Solar Generator, Resiblock, Satellite Silo, Solar Matrix</li>
  <li><b>15HP:</b> Medical Centre, Security Centre, Sensor Array, Missile Silo</li>
  <li><b>16HP:</b> Anti-Missile Pod, Laser Turret</li>
  <li><b>20HP:</b> Hydration Plant, Photon Turret, Plasma Turret, Construction Yard,
      Deep Bore Mine, Mine, Protected Resiblock, Protected Solar Matrix,
      Repair Facility</li>
  <li><b>24HP:</b> Decontamination Filter, Hydroponics, Life Support,
      Storage Facility, Weapons Factory, Gravity Nullifier,
      Seismic Penetrator</li>
  <li><b>28HP:</b> Asteroid Engines</li>
  <li><b>32HP:</b> Protected Storage Tower, Storage Tower</li>
  <li><b>34HP:</b> Environment Control, Power Store, Powerplant</li>
  <li><b>36HP:</b> CPU, Command Centre, Ore Teleporter, Screen Generator</li>
  <li><b>52HP:</b> Protected Environment Control</li>
</ul>

<p>Notably, the Protected Environment Control has just over 50% more hit
points than the unprotected version, while the Protected Resiblock and
Protected Solar Matrix have twice as many hit points as their regular
version. However, the Protected Storage Tower has no additional defence
beyond the laser cannon.</p>

<p>Some alien buildings have more hit points. The Kll'Kp'Qua building
"Queen's Chamber", analogous to the Terran CPU, has 100HP.</p>

<p>The Building Armour blueprint doubles hit points for all new buildings.
With this blueprint, the toughest building available to the player is a
Protected Environment Control, at 104HP.</p>

<h2>Building Armour / Repair Facility</h2>

<p>The Building Armour blueprint only applies to new buildings, not
buildings constructed before you acquired the Building Armour blueprint.
However, if you own the Building Armour blueprint and have built a Repair
Facility, it will begin to retrofit all existing buildings with Building
Armour.</p>

<p>The Repair Facility does not repair ships in orbit. It does repair
ships in hangars. Ships in hangars do not repair at all without a Repair
Facility. There is no way to repair larger ships which cannot use a
Landing Pad.</p>

<h2>Screen Generator</h2>

<p>The Screen Generator reduces all damage by 50%, for all
buildings within its range. The Screen Generator benefits
from its own damage reduction, as long as it's switched on.
Multiple Screen Generators don't stack.</p>

<h2>Ships in hangars</h2>

<p>Ships in hangars do not repair without a Repair Facility.</p>

<p>Even if all Landing Pads are destroyed, ships in hangars
remain safe. They can be recovered once another Landing Pad is
built. The same happens with missiles held in missile bays,
but not ore held in storage towers.</p>

<h2>Buildings</h2>

<p>No matter how large, an asteroid can only have 100
buildings. Building size doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Certain buildings require workers. The following buildings
require eight colonists each: Mine, Deep Bore Mine, Seismic
Penetrator, Construction Yard, Command Centre and Missile Silo.
No other buildings require workers. Ships do not require colonists
for crew.</p>

<h2>Ore</h2>

<p>Asteros ore depletes over time, even if you don't mine
it. This only occurs on colonised asteroids. Asteros you've
already mined does not deplete from your stores. If you have
mines but no ore storage buildings, mines will not waste ore.
Powerplants can use Asteros directly from the mines without
storage buildings.</p>

<h2>Colonists</h2>

<p>You receive money each turn, based on how many colonies you
own and how much population you have. Each day, you receive
an amount which seems to equal 100 credits per colony, plus
2 credits per unit of population. With several asteroids and
a high population, it's possible to earn more from this than
ore sales.</p>

<p>A colony of 1,000 population will give you 2,100 credits per
day or around 357,000 to 672,000 for each time the Imperial
Transporter arrives. However, it may not be the best option.
In order to keep this many unemployed colonists alive and
well-behaved, you'll need 7 resiblocks, 7 security centres,
2 life support, 2 hydration plants, 3 hydroponics, and 10
solar generators. The initial outlay costs 101,100 credits
and requires room for 31 buildings. For protected resiblocks
and one medical facility per 100 citizens, you'll need another
8 solar generators, 100,500 credits and room for 31 buildings.</p>

<p>There may be a better use for asteroids which have run
dry of ore. Build Asteroid Engines and crash them into
an enemy asteroid, or even into your own empty asteroids
or the edge of the screen. Destroying an asteroid causes
a new, fresh one to appear, which will be full of ore.</p>
