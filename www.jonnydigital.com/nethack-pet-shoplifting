<h1>NetHack pet shoplifting guide</h1>

<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->



<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In NetHack, shopkeepers ignore objects that your pet carries out
of the shop. Some pets can be trained to bring you items by feeding
them certain foods when they drop items at your feet. With a
well-trained pet you can stand on the door of a shop and clear
the entire shop out without angering the shopkeeper.</p>

<h2>Stealing from shops</h2>

<p>Stealing from shops is complicated by a few matters.</p>

<p>The most significant is the shopkeeper. He takes many
precautions to prevent thievery: won't let you leave with unpaid
items (even items you already consumed or threw out of the shop),
won't let you enter or leave while invisible, etc. If you manage
to steal anyway, he becomes violent and is very difficult to kill
early on.</p>

<p>Second is alignment. Lawful characters suffer a -1 alignment
penalty when stealing from shops, and lawful and neutral
characters who murder a shopkeeper lose intrinsic telepathy and
two points of luck.</p>

<p>Third is that shopkeepers are usually more useful alive, as
the price they buy items for can be used to help identify them.
It's also considered poor form to kill Izchak.</p>

<h2>Stealing with pets</h2>

<p>Fortunately, there's a loophole. Shopkeepers only watch you,
and ignore pets and other creatures entirely. Any item your
pet eats or picks up is ignored. If a pet drops an item outside
of the shop, it's yours: the shopkeeper forgets he ever owned it,
and you can even sell it back to him (even multiple times).</p>

<p>You can wait until your pet picks up an item, then leave
the shop and hope the pet follows you, or summon the pet with
a magic whistle or blessed eucalyptus leaf. You can also stand
in the doorway and hope the pet drops items on the first square
inside the shop, which is considered "outside" for the purposes
of stealing. However, it's possible to train many pets further.</p>

<h2>Training your pet</h2>

<p>Your pet has an attribute called <i>apport</i> which determines
the likelihood it will pick up and drop items, and how near to
you it will drop them. Apport decreases by 1 each time the pet
drops an item, and increases when the pet eats a treat. What
food it considers a treat varies by animal:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dogs, cats and other meat-eating creatures consider tripe
rations a treat, along with food with 'meat' in the name
(meatball, huge chunk of meat). You can create meatballs by
casting <i>stone to flesh</i> on rocks, and can create
rocks by hitting boulders or statues with a pickaxe. Eggs are
treats, but break if thrown at a pet, the normal delivery
method when raising apport. Corpses are not treats.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Horses and other herbivores consider carrots
and apples a treat.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Monkeys (any Y) consider a banana a treat.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Metal-eating creatures like rust monsters consider
iron objects treats.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Rust monsters consider iron objects treats.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Ghouls and ghasts consider any corpse more than 50
turns old a treat.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Creatures which don't eat, such as demons, treat
no food as treats. They make poor shoplifters as you can't
raise their apport with food.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/pets2.html">Keeping
And Training Pets In Nethack And Slash'EM</a>, the best way
to raise a pet's apport is to throw it a treat immediately
after it drops something at your feet. This will raise apport
by 100. The further away the pet was when he dropped and the
longer you wait before giving the treat, the less apport gain.</p>

<h2>Shoplifting tactics</h2>

<p>If a shop contains treats (usually tripe rations), it's a
good idea to run ahead, shut the door and take these before
your pet can eat them. You'll have to pay, of course, since
you picked it up, but two treats make it easy to rob a shop
blind so it's worth it.</p>

<p>The first square from the door is considered "outside" the
shop. Any item your pet drops here is yours. A common tactic
is to stand in the doorway and hold down 's' or '.' to wait
while your pet drops items at your feet. You can feed him
more treats when he does this, if you have any. A pet with
high apport will make light work of a large shop.</p>

<p>Drop your gold ($) on a square near the door. The
shopkeeper will offer you credit, and your pet can steal
the gold back. Repeat this indefinitely until you have
enough gold to buy any items too heavy for your pet to
pick up.</p>

<p>Sell back items you don't want. This gives you access
to the shopkeeper's gold, as opposed to just store credit.
If you're confident in your pet's shoplifting ability,
pawn artifacts for quick gold.</p>

<p>To save time (and food), you can put all lightweight
items into a sack, drop it near the door and have your
pet steal that.</p>

<h2>Strategies for stubborn pets</h2>

<p>A useful pet tactic is to displace your pet onto
a polymorph trap to make it into a more powerful
creature. This has the drawback that certain creatures
(such as demons) don't eat, and therefore you cannot
raise their apport. Some pets only eat rare
foods as treats, and sometimes you just don't
have any treats handy.</p>

<p>One solution is to place several items into a
bag, then when the pet picks it up, summon him
out of the shop with a magic whistle or blessed
eucalyptus leaf. You can also zap a wand of
teleportation or cast "teleport away" on the
pet.</p>

<p>Non-eating pets have the additional difficulty
that you cannot raise their tameness by feeding,
nor re-tame them by throwing food as with dogs,
cats and ponies.</p>

<h2>Very powerful pets</h2>

<p>I once managed to polytrap a pony into an incubus,
who managed to acquire a fantastic amount of
equipment and experience by killing and stealing.
By the bottom of of the Gnomish Mines he had an AC
of -16 and speed. A mind flayer had recently eaten
my dog so I attempted to use the incubus to shoplift.</p>

<p>Instead of stealing, the incubus murdered every
shopkeeper in Minetown. I had to lock the aligned priest
in for his own safety.</p>

<p>Killing a shopkeeper with a pet, if you can do
so safely, gives you quick access to the entire
shop inventory, all the shopkeeper's gold, and the
shopkeeper's private possessions (including a wand
of striking). There is no alignment penalty for
allowing your pet to murder.</p>

<p>The only real drawback to killing the shopkeeper
is that he can no longer be used to identify items
by price. The maximum amount of gold a shopkeeper
can give you is what he carries.</p>

<h2>Danger</h2>

<p>When stealing, you'll probably want to buy the
last few shop items on credit, rather than waste
time and nutrition having your pet take it. Be
aware that the shopkeeper will sell unidentified
gems as if they are the most expensive type of
their colour.</p>

<p>If your pet needs to eat, it can starve while
you block the door and force it to shoplift.
Pets which do not eat may become un-tame.</p>

<h2>In summary</h2>

<p>Throw tripe rations or meatballs (cast stone
to flesh on rocks) at your cat/dog, or carrots
or apples at your horse, immediately after they
drop an item at your feet, to encourage them to
fetch. Stand in the doorway and let your pet
drop items on the first square, which counts
as outside the shop. Drop gold in the shop for
credit and have your pet steal it back.
Shopkeepers ignore pet thieves.</p>
