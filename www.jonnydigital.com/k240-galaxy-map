<h1>K240 Galaxy Map</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>All stars are are given in galactic coordinates, measured in
distance from Earth's star and degrees from the galactic centre
as viewed from Earth. The first figure is degrees anticlockwise,
and the second is degrees vertically.</p>

<p>Eventually I may draw this up into an actual map. To give
some idea of scale, the Milky Way galaxy is around 100,000 light
years in diameter and 1,000 light years thick, with Earth around
25,000 light years from the centre.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Arcturus sector</dt>
  <dd>Inhabited by the Ax-Zilanths. Named for the star
  Arcturus, approximately 37 light years from Earth,
  15.05&deg; mark 69.11&deg;.</dd>
  
  <dt>Barnard's Star</dt>
  <dd>A red dwarf star, six light years from Earth,
  13.01&deg; mark 14.06&deg;.
  Fully owned by
  Tetracorp by 2280, and home to the Tetracorp Central
  Construction Yards in 2345 and Morgan Design Institute
  in 2308 and 2338.</dd>
  
  <dt>Beta Hydrae</dt>
  <dd>A double star, 330 to 410 light years from Earth,
  289.27&deg; mark 27.41&deg;.
  Location of the industral worlds destroyed in 2301
  by the Tharmaxlons. Beta Hydrae IV is homeworld
  of the Ax-Zilanths.</dd>
  
  <dt>Brekon</dt>
  <dd>A star unknown to 20th Century Terran astronomers,
  or which went by another name. Brekon 7 is home
  to Gax Industries in the year 2278.</dd>

  <dt>Capella sector</dt>
  <dd>Location of the homeworlds of the Tharmaxlons,
  and inhabited by the Ax-Zilanths.
  Named for Capella (Alpha Aurigae), a star system of two
  binary pairs, 42.2 light years from Earth, 162.59&deg;
  mark 4.57&deg;. The two pairs are about one-sixth of a light
  year apart. The size of the Capella sector is unspecified.</dd>
  
  <dt>Deneb Markab</dt>
  <dd>The location of a five year war which took place some
  time between 2210 and 2220. The term is ambiguous, as it
  refers to two stars, Deneb (Alpha Cygni) and Markab
  (Alpha Pegasi). Deneb is approximately 1400 light years
  from Earth, 84.28&deg; mark 2.00&deg;, while Markab is 135 to
  145 light years from Earth, 88.28&deg; mark -40.38&deg;.
  Faster-than-light drive would make such a battle
  possible. Note that Deneb lies far outside what in 2380
  is the Terran Empire.</dd>

  <dt>Deneb Mira</dt>
  <dd>Location of the Deneb Mira star is ambiguous - it
  is named for two real stars, Deneb and Mira. Deneb
  (Alpha Cygni) is approximately 1400 light years from
  Earth, 84.28&deg; mark 2.00&deg;, and Mira (Omicron
  Ceti), a binary star 200-400 light years from Earth,
  167.76&deg; mark -57.99&deg;. It may be an undiscovered
  star, perhaps between these two in space or as observed
  from Earth. Deneb Mira III is the Tylaran homeworld,
  an ice planet far from its primary star.</dd>

  <dt>The Fragmented Sectors</dt>
  <dd>Frontier star systems whose planets have been torn
  apart to produce huge asteroid fields.</dd>
  
  <dt>Galactic core</dt>
  <dd>The centre of the Milky Way galaxy, approximately
  25,000 light years from Earth, 0.00&deg; mark 0.00&deg;.
  Home of the Swixarans.</dd>

  <dt>Home Worlds</dt>
  <dd>The most densely populated worlds nearest to Earth.
  The term has been used since at least 2215.</dd>
  
  <dt>Industrial Worlds</dt>
  <dd>Terran-controlled planets which concentrate industry
  away from population areas and maximize productivity.
  Originally established in 2215 by Emperor Parillo.
  Industrial worlds include Tau Ceti III and multiple planets
  of Beta Hydrae.</dd>

  <dt>M53 (Messier 53)</dt>
  <dd>A globular cluster, around 58,000 light years from
  Earth, 332.97&deg; mark 79.76&deg;.
  Home of the Lak'Maj'Traal, an alien also called the
  Ore Eaters. M53 is erroneously referred to as a galaxy;
  in fact it is a dense star cluster in the Sagittarius
  arm of the Milky Way galaxy. M53 is around 220 light
  years across as viewed from Earth and consists of
  hundreds of thousands of stars.</dd>
  
  <dt>Rigel</dt>
  <dd>A binary star around 800 light years from Earth,
  209.24&deg; mark -25.25&deg;. The Rigel system the home
  system. Rigel is also known as Beta Orionis. There is
  evidence that the Rigellians visited Earth in the
  distant past.</dd>
  
  <dt>Sector K240</dt>
  <dd>One of the Fragmented Sectors. Occupies a cube of
  space 50 light years across. Opened for mining expeditions
  by Tetracorp in 2380. Approximately 300 light years from
  Earth, direction unspecified.</dd>

  <dt>Tau Ceti</dt>
  <dd>A star similar to the Sun, 11 light years from Earth,
  173.10&deg; mark -73.44&deg;.
  Tau Ceti III is homeworld to insect-like alien,
  the Kll-Kp-Qua. In 2232, Tau Ceti III was a Terran Industrial
  World, home to the Kerell Corporation.</dd>
  
  <dt>The Terran Empire</dt>
  <dd>A sphere of approximately 300 light years in radius with
  Earth at its centre. Contains over 1,000 populated worlds.
  Artificial life support technology available in K240 means
  that not all of these planets need have natural Earth-class
  habitability, although presumably some are not habitable
  (such as stars with no stable planets). The Terran Empire
  clearly possesses faster-than-light propulsion. If we assume
  the Imperial Transporter is the same ship each time it
  visits, it must be able to make the 500-700 light year
  round trip to the Home Systems in under 170 days, for
  an average speed of over 1,000 times the speed of light.</dd>
