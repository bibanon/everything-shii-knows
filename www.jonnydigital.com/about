<h1>About</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>This website dates back to a "weblog" around 1998. In 1999 it took on
a distinctive blue theme, and received sporadic updates until 2004. Spinoff
projects included a Dungeons &amp; Dragons website in 2003 titled
<cite>Talen's Forge</cite>, and a <cite>Fullmetal Alchemist</cite> episode
guide in 2004 named <a href="http://www.edwardelric.com">EdwardElric.com</a>.</p>

<p>In 2006, Talen's Forge turned into a blog titled
<a href="http://d20.jonnydigital.com">D20 Source</a>, with over 500
subscribers at current. Jonnydigital.com remained without update until
August 2008, when it undertook a radically minimalist style inspired by
wiki <a href="http://shii.org/knows/">Everything Shii Knows</a>.</p>

<p><cite>Everything Shii Knows</cite> makes a
<a href="http://shii.org/knows/Everything_Shii_Knows:Guarantee">guarantee
of validity</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><cite> Linked at the bottom of every Wikipedia page is this
message: "WIKIPEDIA MAKES NO GUARANTEE OF VALIDITY". Everything Shii Knows
does make a guarantee of validity. Everything on this website is my valid
opinion. It is not written to attract Google hits, make money, or to anger
you. This website contains no vandalism and no alterations from what I
actually know. If I say something is evil, that's because I believe it is
evil. If I tell you the history of Britain, consider it the same as if I
had walked up to you on the street and told you all about it. This website
is guaranteed honest.</cite></blockquote></p>

<p>Please accept this website in the same manner.</p>
