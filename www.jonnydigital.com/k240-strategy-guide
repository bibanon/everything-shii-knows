<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>Ship combat</h2>

<p>Early on, you won't be able to afford an Orbital Space Dock,
and will only be able to build small ships. Your first ships
should be empty Scout Ships to quickly map the other asteroids
and prospect to choose colony sites. Next, your choice is
between Assault Fighters and Combat Eagles.</p>

<p>You'll probably want a fleet specialising in ship combat
and a fleet specialising in ground attack. Since it's hard
to tell ships apart by their armaments, you could make all
Assault Fighters into bombers (Vortex Mine or Napalm Orb)
and fit all Combat Eagles with ship weapons.</p>

<p>Once you have the money, start building ships on every
occupied asteroid. You'll want large ground attack fleets
and large ship combat fleets to escort them. The ship attack
fleets can go first and engage the enemy fleet while the
bombers attack the colony. When your money outstrips your
ship building rate, start building the ships with more
expensive hardpoints.</p>

<p>Small ships will repair in a hangar if you have a Repair
Facility. This requires you to have the ships leave the
fleet, which can be cumbersome.</p>

<p>In combat, always attack with ridiculous overwhelming
numbers where possible.</p>

<h2>Missiles</h2>

<p>Missiles are expensive. A full rack of ten of each non-blueprint
missile will cost 607,000 credits, including the price of 90 units
of red ore and 40 units of yellow ore. Including the blueprint
missiles, a rack of 10 costs about 6,000,000 credits, including
180 red, 60 yellow and 20 green ore, not including an additional
1,500,000 in blueprints.</p>

<p>The advantage of missiles is that a large strike can deal a lot
of damage before the enemy can rebuild, and a lucky hit can take
out. A strike too small to obliterate an asteroid can still weaken
its buildings and defences enough for a fleet to finish the job.
Missiles also move at 4FN, faster than any ships, and cannot
be intercepted by ships. However, they have a miss chance based
on range, and can be shot down. They also only hit once,
unlike ships with air to ground weapons which can fire multiple
times before the ship is destroyed.</p>

<p>Probably the best overall missile is Nuclear, which strikes
every building on an asteroid at once, as well as ships in
orbit. A few hits can wipe out a colony. It's expensive, at
300,000 credits for the blueprint and 50,000 per missile,
but worth it. Given the cost, it's best to fire Nuclears in
groups of two to five, along with ten or twenty cheap
Explosive missiles to decrease the chance that a Nuclear
missile will be shot down.</p>

<p>Since miss chance increases by range and missiles can't
be transferred between asteroids, it's vital to only
build missiles with a nearby target in mind. The average
effect of a 50% miss chance due to range is to double
the price per successful missile. Ore Teleporters make
it much more feasible to send the right ores to distant
missile-producing worlds. It's worth using Asteroid
Engines to close range with the enemy asteroid while
building missiles.</p>

<p>In general, missiles are a great way to deal a lot of
damage in a short space of time, if you have a lot of
money.</p>

<h2>Asteroid movement</h2>

<p>A vital tactic is to ram an enemy asteroid with a colony
equipped with Asteroid Engines. Unlike missiles and ships,
asteroid ramming cannot be countered except by destroying
the approaching colony or moving out of the way. In particular,
the Ax'Zilanths have asteroid teleporters for this purpose,
and the Tylarans have Asteroid Engines capable of moving
at speed 8.</p>

<p>Your colony moves at 0.02FN per point of speed, or one
pixel every fifty days. At speed 5, an asteroid will move
one pixel every ten days, and cross one sector (the screen
is 8 by 5 sectors) in 400 days. It's a good idea to keep
colonies away from the sides of the screen, since they will
collide with new asteroids.</p>

<p>Establishing a colony for the sole purpose of ramming is
expensive. A new colony and Asteroid Engines costs
75,000 credits and take at 104 days. Your CPU will only
produce food and water for 250 days, long enough to build
the engines and move the asteroid 18.6 pixels, or just
under half of one sector. Basic life support beyond this
will bring the cost to 102,500.</p>

<p>A useful side-effect of ramming is that two asteroids
are removed from play, causing two new ones to enter from
the edge of the screen. Asteroid ramming can be used to
get rid of an asteroid that's been emptied of ore and
generate a new one.</p>

<h2>Blueprints</h2>

<p>Be selective when choosing blueprints.</p>

<p>Early on, you'll want the Gravity Nullifier, if it wasn't
provided for you at the start. This is vital to avoid
asteroid crashes once you start building colonies. It's also
useful for rescuing valuable asteroids from collision. Bear
in mind that asteroids appearing at the edge of the screen
are vulnerable to collision with asteroids, so you'll want
Asteroid Engines as one of your first purchases. Engines
are extremely useful for crashing enemy asteroids, closing
missile range, moving out of missile range, or establishing
a wider sensor network.</p>

<p>Second-generation mines are useful when you're in a race
against time to generate income and expand faster than the
enemy. Buy Seismic Penetrator as soon as you find Traxium
or Nexos and can spare the funds. The blueprint and one
Seismic Penetrator cost 146,500 credits together, which one
unit of Nexos or two of Traxium will pay for.</p>

<p>Once you have several colonies, your priorities change
from saving money to spending it on offence and defence,
and saving effort. The most vital blueprint is Ore Teleporter,
which lets you import ore easily to your main asteroid for sale
and manufacture, send ore out for distribute ore out for
large-scale ship or missile production, evacuate ore from an
endangered colony, and transfer ore quickly if the Imperial
Transporter shows up at the wrong asteroid.</p>

<p>Other convenience technologies are the Asteroid Tracker
(useful in combination with the Asteroid Engines) and
Construction Droids (when you want multiple colonies all
producing small ships as fast as they can).</p>

<p>Start buying offensive and defensive tech as money allows.
Nuclear missiles are extremely effective and
even a few can wipe out a colony. If your ship production
ability exceeds your income and you're using a fleet-heavy
strategy, start building better-equipped ships - buy
Fleet Battleship, Shield x50, Deflector and perhaps
Terminator. Defensively, the Repair Facility, Building
Armour, Anti-Virus Missile and Anti-Missile Pod become
important, especially later on if the enemy sends powerful
missiles.</p>

<p>Later, when you have so much money you can't spend it quickly
enough, start investing heavily in blueprints. Absolutely
buy up all the offensive and defensive tech you can make use
of, plus Missile Bay Extension (if you plan to make heavy
use of missiles). Also buy any cheap tech you missed, like
2nd Generation Mines or Power Amplifier. If defence is stil
a problem but you have Solar Matrix and cash, build a lot of
Protected Solar Matrix buildings and dot your asteroids
with Shield Generators.</p>

<p>The high end Virus and Mega missiles are tempting, but
are even more expensive than they appear. As the ores
required are rare and valuable, you'll want to sell them
early on, and later when you can afford the blueprint
you might have enough for only ten of each missile. Including
the blueprint and the opportunity cost of keeping the ore,
ten Mega missiles cost around 4,950,000 credits, and ten Virus
missiles 1,215,000 credits. Either missile will destroy a
colony in one successful hit, but so will five Nuclear missiles,
whose ore is in plentiful supply, and a single Mega missile is
more likely to be shot down than a barrage of Nuclears.</p>

<p>Stasis can be used to freeze an asteroid
so many incoming missiles strike at once when the stasis
wears off, overwhelming anti-missile defence,
but again, a few Nuclears will do the same job, and
the Stasis missile itself could be shot down. A similar
en-masse missile effect can be achieved simply by building
ten or twenty silos on the one asteroid, costing 4300 per
silo with no power use. Avoiding the use of Stasis altogether
also lets you sell all Korellium ore, which has no other use.</p>

<p>The Powerplant is rubbish - it consumes Asteros ore, and
most asteroids have only enough to sustain two reactors for
200 to 1000 days. For the same price as the Powerplant
blueprint and one Powerplant, you could buy the Solar Matrix
blueprint and build four to produce the same amount of power.
The next Solar Matrix will cost twice as much to build
as a Powerplant per megawatt, but money regenerates, while
Asteros is in short supply (and needed later on for Nuclear
missiles).
Once you have the Power Amplifier, four Solar Generators
will generate the same power as a Powerplant in the same
area, build twice as fast for 60% of the price, and won't
consume ore.</p>

<p>Improved Sensors is another crappy tech. For the price
of this blueprint, you can build Sensor Arrays on eight
colonies, plus enough Solar Generators to power them.
The advantage of the blueprint is that you save one square
and 2MW per asteroid, can't lose sensors in an attack,
and sensors kick in immediately upon colonization instead
of 36 days later.</p>
