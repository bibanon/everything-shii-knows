<h1>Guilty Gear music references</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>Back in 2006 I did some work cataloguing music references in
the Guilty Gear videogame series for Wikipedia. Unfortunately,
since it's impossible to provide citations for these, they have
since been removed from Wikipedia. As an alternative, I'm
listing them here.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the people who have helped to build this list.</p>

<h2>Character references</h2>

  <dt>Chipp Zanuff</dt>
  <dd>Chipp Zanuff is named for Chip Z'nuff, vocalist for glam rock band Enuff Z' Nuff. The opening guitar riff of Chipps's theme "Suck a Sage" arguably resembles the main riff of "Loved to Death" by Megadeth.</dd>
  
  <dt>Dizzy</dt>
  <dd>Dizzy seems to be named for Guns N' Roses member Darren 'Dizzy' Reed, and shares her name with Tommy Roe's 1969 hit. The main guitar riff of Dizzy's theme "Awe of She" resmebles the intro to "Liar" by Helloween. Her "Skull Crusher" attack references Overkill's song "Skull Krusher", while her Hunger Strike attack shares a name with song by grunge band Temple of the Dog.

According to the game manual, Sol's hobby is "Listening to Queen" and his favourite thing is Queen's 1974 album Sheer Heart Attack. His Napalm Death is a British grindcore band. Sol's name is a near-anagram of Bal-Sagoth, although this may be a coincidence. Tenuously, Sol's swordfighting technique resembles Freddie Mercury's microphone stand "swordfighting" against Christopher Lambert in the Princes of the Universe video.</dd>

Zato's theme, "Feel a Fear", seems to have an opening similar to the opening guitar riffs in the White Zombie song "Grease Paint and Monkey Brains." In the original Guilty Gear, Zato-1's theme "Black Soul" and his stage's background reference the album Souls of Black by Testament.

<h2>Other references</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The original Guilty Gear was subtitled "The Missing Link", a name shared by a Rage album.</li>
  <li>Guilty Gear X's title screen shows a subtitle of "[BY YOUR SIDE "G.GEAR"]" - referencing the Black Crowes album By Your Side.</li>
  <li>The word Slash refers to a strong normal attack (as in Slash/Hard Slash) and "Slash" is announced when a victory occurs by knockout. This is also the name of former Guns N' Roses member Saul 'Slash' Hudson.</li>
  <li>Each fight is announced with the line "Heaven or Hell". This arguably references Black Sabbath's album "Heaven and Hell" or The Who's song of the same name. Although Gamma Ray also released song of this name in 2001, the original Guilty Gear predates this, having been released in 1998.</li>
  <li>An album containing Guilty Gear vocal tracks was released in Japan, named Rising Force of Gear Image Vocal Tracks, a reference to Yngwie Malmsteen album Rising Force. Of the three CDs of the album, one is titled Side I - ROCK YOU!! (a reference to Queen song We Will Rock You) and the second Side II - SLASH!! (a reference to guitarist Slash).

The lyrics to that album's title track are printed on the inside back cover of the "Guilty Gear X Drafting Artworks" art book published by Enterbrain.</li>
  <li>Arguably, Eddie's stage in Guilty Gear XX references to the American heavy metal band, Iced Earth.</li>
