<h1>Schnoebelen's so-called "Straight Talk" on D&amp;D</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>Around 1990, William Schnoebelen wrote
<a href="http://www.chick.com/articles/dnd.asp">Straight Talk on Dungeons and Dragons</a>,
an article claiming to prove that D&amp;D is a ploy to attract young
people into Satanism and the occult. The author backs up these claims
by citing himself as an expert in Satanism, but there's a simple 
logical flaw in his argument - he's not an expert in D&amp;D, not
by a long shot.</p>

<p>Take this quote as an example: </p>

<blockquote>"Now, the question becomes--if a person "innocently"
works an authentic ritual that conjures up a demon, or curses
someone; thinking that they are only playing a game-might not
the ritual still have efficacy?"</blockquote>

<p>Schnoebelen fails to realise the difference between "actual"
satanic demon-summoning rituals, and fictional creature-summoning
in a game. For those of you not familiar with D&amp;D, let me
explain how a player might go about "summoning a demon".</p>

<p><b>Player</b>: "I cast summon monster v, to summon a quasit."<br>
<b>DM</b>: "A small, horned creature appears in a flash of fire,
and charges at your enemy with his claws flailing."</p>

<p>Maybe it's just me, but I fail to see how merely stating
that a fictional game character takes a certain action, can
make it true in the real world. (If it was, we would see huge
red-skinned trident-wielding monsters rampaging through our
cities.) Nobody who knew D&amp;D could fail to make this
distinction. The result? Schnoebelen quite literally doesn't
know what he's talking about. </p>

<p>He goes on to state that the D&amp;D rules give Adolf Hitler
as an example of a person with high Charisma. This is true,
if I recall correctly, at least for earlier versions of the
D&amp;D rules. However, fuzzy logic creeps in when Schnoebelen
uses the Hitler reference to prove that D&amp;D promotes evil
values. In reality, the game does not actually suggest that
players take Hitler as a role-model - it merely states that
Hitler was persuasive and a natural leader, which is what D&amp;D
Charisma represents. </p>

<p>One of the most vicious rumors about D&amp;D is that it has
caused players to go nuts and kill themself. The article perpetuates
this rumour, giving a list of D&amp;D players who reportedly killed
themself or others because of the game. This evidence might hold
water, except that there's often little or nothing actually
connecting the deaths to D&amp;D. (After all, Adolf Hitler was
a Christian - does this prove that he was a good person, or that
all Christians are murderers?) There is of course, a more logical
reason. </p>

<p>It's an unfortunate fact that each year, thousands of depressed,
misunderstood teenagers take their own lives. Often, these people
are social outcasts - the ones who get picked on at school by the
popular kids for being different. Coincidentally, this same
demographic of social outcasts make up much of D&amp;D's teenage
playerbase (the "cool kids" play sports, not roleplaying games).
Statistically, therefore, teenage D&amp;D players are slightly
more likely to commit suicide than their well-adjusted popular
counterparts - and it's got nothing to do with the game itself.</p>

<p>Schnoebelen is looking at D&amp;D from the point of view of
someone well-versed in the occult, and so he's taking the game
out of context. Magic, curses and demon-summoning all mean
different things to a true occultist than they do to a gamer -
where an occultist performs actual rituals which he believes
to be magical, a game player merely rolls some dice, knowing
clearly that the game is fictional. An interviewer could ask
an occultist to explain how a certain magical ritual is performed
in great detail, but at a D&amp;D game the player has no such 
nowledge, able only to say "My character casts a maximized
fireball, dealing 60 points of damage".</p>

<p>In his enthusiasm, Schnoebelen seems to have glossed over
the distinction between player and character, the most basic
concept of any role-playing game. Sounds to me like he was too
busy freaking out after finding all those "demons" in the
Monstrous Manual.</p>
