<h1>How do I configure WinUAE?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>The Amiga emulator <cite>WinUAE</cite> does a pretty great job
of simulating the computer that was said to be impossible to
emulate. On top of all the advanced proprietary hardware, the
Amiga was released in over ten discrete versions, plus several
third-party expansions, all of which WinUAE can handle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this complexity means that WinUAE has sixteen
pages of configuration options, which are all the more difficult
if you're not very familiar with the Amiga. I'll go through
the options and tell you what works best for me.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Download WinUAE</h2>

<p>WinUAE releases important updates, so <a href="http://www.winuae.net/frames/download.html">go and download it again</a>.
This tutorial assumes you're using WinUAE 1.5.1; newer versions
should be much the same.</p>

<p>Next, source at least one Kickstart ROM image; if you don't
have this already, it's sort of the Amiga's equivalent to the
modern PC's BIOS. This is copyrighted software so I won't
post it here, but you can find it online easily enough. For
maximum game compatibility I recommend that you collect the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amiga 500, Kickstart v1.3. Best compatibility with old games (pre-1992).</li>
  <li>Amiga 600HD, Kickstart v2.05. Supports newer games that benefit from the ECS chipset</li>
  <li>Amiga 1200, Kickstart v3.0 or v3.1. Supports AGA chipset games.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take care not to confuse ROM with its meaning on other
consoles, where the game software came on ROM chips in
cartridges; Amiga software came on floppy disks, with
the basic operating system in an internal ROM chip. Disk
images of Amiga games are referred to as ADFs, or
<a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/definition-adf">Amiga Disk Files</a>.</p>

<h2>Hardware configuration</h2>

<p>The "Quickstart" page here will set most of the options you
want, and the tooltips can advise you on certain configurations.
Here are my recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A1200, basic non-expanded configuration: Use this for games
  requiring the AGA chipset. They're usually listed as "AGA Only"
  or "Requires A1200/A4000".</li>
  <li>A600, 2MB Chip RAM expanded configuration: Use this for
  games made after 1991. Certain games before this had trouble
  with the newer A600, but after this many A500-compatible
  games were able to take advantage of the A600's improvements.</li>
  <li>A500: Use this for games that the A600 has trouble with, or
  if you don't have the A600 ROM. Use the tooltips to help
  decide which configuration to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should suffice for a lot of software, but you may still
wish to fine-tune the hardware settings from here.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>CPU and FPU</dt>
  <dd>For games, you have three real options. Most games used
  the 68000 CPU at about 7MHz, so "Match A500 Speed" should
  suffice. The A1200, A4000 and CD32 require the 68020 CPU and
  "Fastest possible", since it ran at 14MHz. Only some later
  high-spec games (1995 onward) require the faster CPUs, which
  actually caused many old games to run too fast.</dd>
  
  <dt>Chipset</dt>
  <dd>The defaults should pick OCS for A500, AGA for A1200,
  and Full ECS for A600. On an Athlon XP 1700 you should
  be able to run with Collision Level at "Sprites and Sprites
  vs. Playfield" and Sound Emulation at "Emulated, 100% Accurate".
  On a faster machine, also set "Cycle-exact"; on a much slower,
  you may need reduce the options. Only set Collision Level
  to Full for games that appear to require it.</dd>
  
  <dt>Adv. Chipset</dt>
  <dd>99% of the time you don't need to change any of these.</dd>
  
  <dt>ROM</dt>
  <dd>This should be set by the Quickstart settings. Avoid
  wacky combinations (like an A500 ROM with the AGA chipset).</dd>
  
  <dt>RAM</dt>
  <dd>For most games, 1MB Chip RAM and no other RAM is a safe
  bet, but reducing it to 512KB may solve compatibility
  issues with older A500 games. You should have at least 1MB
  for A500+/A600, and 2MB for A1200 games. A few newer games
  benefit from additional Fast RAM.</dd>
  
  <dt>Floppy Drives</dt>
  <dd>Insert your 'disks' (or rather diskfiles) here. Although
  it's usually safe to enable multiple disk drives, bear in
  mind that many games didn't support more than one or two
  drives. Don't meddle too much with the Floppy Drive Emulation
  Speed; it may confuse some games or cause them to crash
  entirely.</dd>
  
  <dt>Hard drives</dt>
  <dd>You can ignore this for games, but feel free to set
  up a hard drive and install Workbench from floppy disks
  if you're up to it. It's useful for non-game software
  and <a href="transferring-amiga-disks">transferring Amiga disks</a>.
  If you mount PC drives, remember that Amiga viruses
  can attack those drives.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Host configuration</h2>

<p>This requires more configuration than the hardware, since
there's no Quickstart option. Your settings will rely largely
on your PC's speed. I've configured my own for an Athlon XP
1700, so when I say "fast computer" or "slow computer" that's
my benchmark.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Display</dt>
  <dd>For windowed, the defaults should be 720x568, resolution
  Hires, Line Mode Double. You shouldn't have to reduce Refresh
  unless your computer is very slow. Note that Fullscreen mode
  doesn't perform any scaling or centering; you should either
  set this under the Filter options, or run 800*600 with
  Centering set to Horizontal.</dd>
  
  <dt>Sound</dt>
  <dd>I set Sound Emulation to "Enabled, 100% accurate", with
  automatic switching enabled and a Sound Buffer Size of
  2. Disable Interpolation; it doesn't do much except
  eat CPU cycles that would be better used making the sound
  emulate correctly. (Slow computers may have to increase
  the sound buffer size to solve errors). I like to enable
  Floppy Drive Sound Emulation on all drives, since as on
  the real Amiga it lets you know when the game is loading
  and not just stalled. I usually reduce the volume to
  20%.</dd>
  
  <dt>Game &amp; I/O Ports</dt>
  <dd>Odds are the only things you'll need to set here are
  the joystick port. I recommend investing in a real digital
  joystick like the replica Competition Pro USB (see
  <a href="http://www.amigakit.com">AmigaKit.com</a>). You
  might alternatively use a joypad with a digital control,
  such as a Playstation controller via a USB adaptor or an
  XBox 360 controller. Otherwise, I recommend Keyboard
  Layout B, but bear in mind that some games (such as Myth)
  require the cursor keys.</dd>
  
  <dt>Input</dt>
  <dd>Fiddle with this is your joystick isn't working. The
  defaults are normally fine.</dd>
  
  <dt>Output</dt>
  <dd>Recording videos of play is its own barrel of worms.
  I won't go into detail about the process; it's already
  covered by sites like <a href="http://www.recordedamigagames.org">Recorded Amiga Games</a>.</dd>
  
  <dt>Filter</dt>
  <dd>Use these to scale if you're using fullscreen modes
  above 800x600. Note that you'll need a fast computer
  to handle most of these options. Note the PAL filter,
  which deliberately makes your look output like a crappy
  TV image.</dd>
  
  <dt>Disk Swapper</dt>
  <dd>I have to be honest, I haven't used this.</dd>
  
  <dt>Misc</dt>
  <dd>You can ignore most of these. If you're using a full-screen
  mode I recommend enabling On-screen LEDs if you want to track
  disk drive lights and CPU usage.</dd>
  
  <dt>Priority</dt>
  <dd>Defaults should be fine.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Remember to save out options once you've got them working how
you like them. Keep note of the CPU access meter at the bottom of
the WinUAE window. If it's low, you can afford to enable extra
power-hungry features like Chipset Cycle-exact and filtering
modes. If it's high, try reducing features, especially if you
experience sound stuttering or slowdown.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>How do I transfer Amiga disks?</dt>
	<dd>This warrants its own article. See
	<a href="transferring-amiga-disks">How do I transfer Amiga disks?</a></dd>

	<dt>Where do I get Amiga joysticks?</dt>
	<dd>Amigakit.com sells a replica of the Competition Pro
	(the black joystick with the red stick) in both Amiga
	and USB form.
	See the article <a href="where-do-i-get-joysticks">Where do I get Amiga joysticks?</a></dd>

  <dt>How do I avoid sound stuttering?</dt>
  <dd>First, try updating to the newest version. My sound
  stuttering went away completely when I updated from
  v1.4.2 to v1.5.1. If that's not it, disable power-hungry
  features to reduce CPU load, or increase the
  sound buffer size. An Athlon XP 1700 emulating an A500
  should not require more than a sound buffer of 2.
  Don't set the sound buffer too high, or the audio
  will lag.</dd>
  
  <dt>What games are worth downloading?</dt>
  <dd>It's a matter of opinion, but there are a few lists.
  Try <a href="http://www.warblade.as/feature01.html">The Amiga Report Top 100 Games of All Time</a>
  and the <a href="http://amr.abime.net/amr_amiga_power_top_100.php">Amiga Power All-Time Top 100 Games (1991-1996)</a>.
  See also my own list of <a href="amiga-games">recommended Amiga games</a>.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>How can I avoid messing around with diskfiles?</dt>
  <dd>Look into something called <a href="http://www.whdload.de/">WHDLoad</a>,
  which allows hard-disk installs of games originally
  created as floppy disk only.</dd>
  
  <dt>How do I ensure maximum game compatibility?</dt>
  <dd>You had three main waves of Amiga games. The first
  was released for the Amiga 500, which had a 7MHz 68000
  CPU and 512KB RAM and was released in 1987. The second
  wave took advantage of 1MB RAM, which includes upgraded
  A500s, the A500+ (1991) and the A600 (1992). The third
  was AGA games, which were A1200/A4000 only and expected
  2MB RAM. Many first-wave games were incompatible with
  newer hardware. Some late-era Amiga games (1995-2002)
  took advantage of third-party expansion hardware;
  perhaps most spectacularly there is a functional Amiga
  port of Quake 2.</dd>
