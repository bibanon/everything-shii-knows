<h1>K240 cheats</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<h2>Help codes</h2>

<p><a href="k240">K240</a> is more interesting without using
cheat codes for an easy win. Nevertheless, here they are.
To use these codes, hit Return, type the code, and hit Return
again. You can use the same 'Return' to both end one code and
start another, for long chains of codes.</p>

<p>Early game code referred to these as "help codes".</p>

<dl>
  <dt>SKYSCRAPER</dt>
  <dd>Build time reduced to 1 day for all buildings.</dd>
  
  <dt>PANEL</dt>
  <dd>Extracts a useful set of buttons. Buttons don't
  appear until you rotate the view once, enter space view
  and return, or similar.</dd>
  
  <dt>NASA</dt>
  <dd>Create a ship at the current asteroid. When prompted,
  press 1 through 8 to create the following ship: Assault
  Fighter (1), Combat Eagle (2), Scout Ship (3), Destructor
  (4), Terminator (5), Transporter (6), Fleet Battleship
  (7), and Orbital Space Dock (8). All ships are generated
  with random hardpoints. This cheat is useful to create
  a Scout Ship directly at an asteroid for quick geological
  survey, or a Transporter there for quick colonization.
  For fun, generate an Orbital Space Dock at an enemy
  asteroid.</dd>
  
  <dt>ICEMAN</dt>
  <dd>Toggle asteroid movement.</dd>
  
  <dt>TRACEY</dt>
  <dd>Toggle voice.</dd>
  
  <dt>BJORK</dt>
  <dd>Speech test. Press A to U to test sounds, and Escape
  or Return to resume game. (Press other keys such as numbers
  for a fun glitch.)</dd>
  
  <dt>WIDGET</dt>
  <dd>Toggle which blueprints you own (gain all blueprints you don't
  own, lose all blueprints you do.)</dd>
  
  <dt>NOISES</dt>
  <dd>Sound test. Press A to W to test sounds, and Escape
  to resume game.</dd>
  
  <dt>LOADSADOSH</dt>
  <dd>Gain 100,000 credits.</dd>
  
  <dt>ICBM</dt>
  <dd>Places four of each missile and four spy satellites
  at the current asteroid. If you have more than four, you
  lose them. Also works with alien asteroids.</dd>
  
  <dt>TELESCOPE</dt>
  <dd>Toggle ability to see all asteroids, and view
  alien colonies without a spy satellite.</dd>
  
  <dt>LEMINGS</dt>
  <dd>Add fifty population to current asteroid. A glitch
  allows you to put colonists on an uncolonized asteroid
  and quickly place buildings, but the colonists die
  quickly and the building explodes since you don't have
  a colony there. You can't use this to put buildings on
  an alien asteroid.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>See alien asteroid without spy satellite</h2>

<p>Bind an F-key to an alien asteroid. Go in to one of your
asteroids or an uninhabited asteroid, and hit the F-key
for the alien asteroid. You'll get a message that you can't
view an alien colony without a spy satellite, but you'll
be able to see the enemy asteroid for a second first.
You can also do this in orbit view (above the asteroid).</p>

<h2>Extra bonus alien?</h2>

<p>According to a rumour, an extra hard alien can be found
by loading a game with Disk 2 in DF0:. This is false.
Presumably, someone had a copy of the game where someone
had saved their game on Disk 2 by mistake.</p>

<h2>Fire alien missiles (CU Amiga K240 demo only)</h2>

<p>In the <a href="k240-cu-amiga-coverdisk">K240 CU Amiga
demo</a>, a bug lets you fire the enemy's missiles. See
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RT6RDBGiQk">Thiima52's
Youtube video demonstrating these bugs</a>.</li>.</p>
