<h1>How do I transfer Amiga disks?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>A common question on Amiga forums is, "How do I transfer data
to/from an Amiga"? You may wish to transfer Amiga disks to a PC
to use in WinUAE, backup data from an old Amiga, or copy software
to an Amiga from the Internet.</p>

<p>You have two problems to solve. The first is how to transfer
data between Amiga and PC, when PC disk drives cannot read Amiga
floppy disks and the two share no networking standard by default.
The second is how to copy a floppy disk into a format a PC can
use.</p>

<h2>Reading Amiga disks</h2>

<p>An Amiga disk can be copied to a single file called an ADF, using
a program called <cite>transdisk</cite> supplied with Amiga emulator
<a href="http://www.winuae.net/">WinUAE</a>. This file contains a
representation of the complete disk, like an ISO file for a CD. An
ADF can be used in WinUAE or written back to an actual disk.</p>

<p>The following command reads the disk in DF0:, the internal
floppy disk drive, to a file on the ram disk:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>transdisk &gt;RAM:<cite>filename</cite>.adf</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to write an ADF to a floppy disk, such as to play
a game downloaded from the Internet, use this command to write a
diskfile to DF0:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>transdisk -w <cite>filename</cite>.adf</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods of data transfer</h2>

<p>Of the following, I recommend a PCMCIA SD card adaptor if you
have an A600 or A1200, using CrossDOS to copy the required drivers
over. If you only have Workbench 1.x, use Amiga Explorer.</p> 

<h3>CrossDOS</h3>

<p><b>Cost: &pound;0</b></p>
<p><b>Compatible with:</b> Workbench 2.04 and up</p>
<p>CrossDOS is an Amiga filesystem which allows an Amiga to read
PC-formatted floppy disks. It comes with Workbench 2.1 and up,
but works with Workbench 2.0. Enter <code>mount pc0:</code> into
the command-line to activate.</p>

<p>As the Amiga only has a double density floppy drive as standard,
you can only read 720KB formatted disks and not 1.44MB high density
formatted disks. A spare Amiga disk formatted on PC is good for this.
The 720KB limit causes problems when copying Amiga disk images, which
are 880KB. See "Methods of data compression" below for solutions.</p>

<p>There's another guide at l8r.net called
<a href="http://www.l8r.net/technical/t-crossdos.shtml">How To Use CrossDos On Your Amiga</a>.</p>

<h3>PCMCIA SD card/CompactFlash reader</h3>

<p><b>Cost: &pound;10</b></p>
<p><b>Compatible with:</b> Amiga 600 / 1200</b></p>
<p>A PCMCIA CompactFlash or SD card reader is one of the best Amiga
peripherals you can buy right now. It's essentially like a floppy
drive, but fast, silent, has 1GB+ capacity and compatible with just
about everything (including your PC, your camera and mobile phone).</p> 

<p>The <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.23720">EDUP MCR-5A</a>
PCMCIA SD-card adaptor sells for &pound;4.59 including shipping. It should work on
all A600 and A1200s, and I've personally tested it on an A1200 with WB2.1 and
a 1GB Corsair 60x SD card. You'll need two drivers from Aminet:
<a href="http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/cfd">cfd.lha</a> to add
CompactFlash and SD support, and
<a href="http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/fat95">fat95.lha</a> to support
Windows filesystem. You may need to format the card under Windows as
"FAT" or FAT16".</p>

<p>Whichever card reader you use, you'll need something else to get
the drivers to the Amiga in the first place. You can use CrossDOS as
the drivers are only about 200KB. If you don't have a hard disk in the
Amiga you'll need to make a Workbench disk with these drivers installed.
On the PC side, you can buy a USB to CF/SD adaptor quite cheaply.</p>

<h3>Internal IDE CF reader or (2.5" hard disk)</h3>
<p><b>Cost: &pound;10</b></p>
<p><b>Compatible with:</b> Any IDE-equipped Amiga (incl. A600 and A1200)</p>
<p>An IDE CompactFlash or SD reader is a cheap, noise-free alternative to an
internal hard disk. It has advantages and disadvantages compared to a
PCMCIA CF/SD reader.</p>

<p>An IDE to CF adaptor requires no drivers, and consequently can be
formatted with the Amiga filesystem used as a boot device like a normal
hard disk. It works with Amigas that have IDE but not PCMCIA (A4000, A4000T,
expanded Amigas). The drawbacks are that you'll need to open the Amiga
to remove the card, and you'll need WinUAE to read the Amiga filesystem.
I don't own one of these devices so I can't recommend any particular model.</p>

<p>If you've got a spare 2.5" hard disk kicking around you can put it in
the Amiga. It can be connected to a PC using a USB hard disk enclosure and
read via WinUAE. For the A600/A1200 you'll probably want a
<a href="http://amigakit.leamancomputing.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=24&products_id=184">hard disk cradle</a> to make sure it fits in snugly. Remember that Amiga has
limits on partition size, and some early A600s are said to have faulty IDE
control in ROM. My own 2.5" hard disk is 4GB and has two 2GB partitions.</p>

<h3>Serial cable with Amiga Explorer</h3>
<p><b>Cost: &pound;18.20</b></p>
<p><b>Compatible with:</b> All Amigas, Workbench 1.2 or higher</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amigaforever.com/ae/">Amiga Explorer</a> is
a networking solution which uses a null modem cable. It cleverly
solves the problem of how to get its own software to the PC side,
by sending an installer over the serial cable. The full version is
&euro;14.95 from Cloanto.</p>

<p>The drawbacks are that transfers are slow (see "transfer rates",
below), you're limited by the length of your cable, and many PCs
don't have serial ports any more, requiring a USB to serial adaptor.
However, it's the primary option for A500 users without IDE ports.
As a bonus, you can run WinUAE and play multiplayer Populous.</p>

<h3>ADFRead/Disk2FDI</h3>
<p><b>Cost: &pound;15</b></p>
<p><b>Compatible with:</b> Some PCs</p>
<p><a href="http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=22596">ADFRead</a>
is a PC program that does the impossible: allows a PC disk drive to
read an Amiga disk. Due to the unique way it works, ADFRead requires
a PC with two internal floppy drives (not USB floppy drives). It
can only read disks, not write, and can only read standard format
disks (many games used copy-protected non-standard format).</p>

<p>Disk2FDI is an older program which does something similar.</p>

<h3>Ethernet</h3>
<p><b>Cost: &pound;30+</b></p>
<p><b>Compatible with:</b> Any PCMCIA/Zorro-equipped Amiga with hard disk and 2MB+ RAM</p>
<p>An Ethernet setup is the most complex and expensive setup
listed here. A600/A1200 users can find the
<a href="http://amigakit.leamancomputing.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=32&products_id=116">EasyNet PCMCIA network card</a> for &pound;30, and big-box Amiga users
can expect to fork out a whopping &pound;88.88 for the Zorro-based
<a href="http://amigakit.leamancomputing.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=32&products_id=250">X-Surf 3CC</a>. You'll then need to copy a lot of software to the PC by
some other method, install MUI, setup TCP/IP software,
manage connecting this to a Windows network, and setup Windows-style
network shares.</p>

<p>On the plus side, this heavy setup will let you hook your
Amiga up to the Internet.</p>

<h2>Transfer rates</h2>

<p>I ran some speed tests using
<a href="http://aminet.net/package/disk/moni/DiskSpeed42">DiskSpeed 4.2</a>
on a stock A1200. Testing with a 262144 byte, MEMF_CHIP, LONG-aligned buffer.
Amiga floppy and ramdisk included for comparison.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>CrossDOS floppy</b>: 6,451 bytes/sec write, 11,159 bytes/sec read</li>
	<li><b>Amiga floppy</b>: 10,256 bytes/sec write, 22,285 bytes/sec read</li>
	<li><b>PCMCIA SD Card</b>: 499,321 bytes/sec write, 862,105 bytes/sec read</li>
	<li><b>Hard disk</b>: 943,198 bytes/sec write, 1,443,877 bytes/sec read</li>
	<li><b>Ram disk</b>: 1,886,396 bytes/sec write, 1,928,490 bytes/sec read</li>
</ul>

<p>Serial transfer is limited to around 19.2 kbit/sec on A500/A600 and
57.6 kbit/sec on A1200, for transfer rates no more than 2KB/sec or 7KB/sec.
This is slower than CrossDOS floppy, but more convenient.</p>

<p>The Amiga 600/1200 IDE uses PIO Mode 0, which has a limit of 3.3MB/s.
You'll actually get less than this on the Amiga as CPU is the limiting
factor (this is why earlier Amigas used SCSI). In my test the
hard disk transfer used 94%-100% CPU and only reached 1.38MB/sec, and
even the ramdisk only reached 1.84MB. This suggests that you're unlikely
to exceed 2MB/sec without expensive specialist hardware like an accelerator
card.</p>

<p>The PCMCIA SD card device can write a floppy disk image in under two
minutes, which is over twenty times faster than the disk drive can read it.
This is probably good enough.</p>

<h2>Methods of data compression</h2>

<p>The main reason you'll want to compress data is if you're using
CrossDOS and want to fit an 880KB Amiga disk image onto a 720KB PC
disk. It's also useful if your transfer method is very slow or unreliable.</p>

<h3>LHA</h3>

<p><a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/arc/lha">LHA</a> is the Amiga
standard archiver, and can also be read under Windows by WinRAR or 7-Zip.
Compress the disk image like so:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>transdisk &gt;RAM:<cite>filename</cite>.adf</code></li>
  <li><code>lha a <cite>filename</cite>.lha <cite>filename</cite>.adf</code></li>
</ul>

<p>There's a snag, however: lha might not reduce the filesize enough
to fit on the 720K floppy. The solution is to read or write the file in
two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>transdisk &gt;RAM:<cite>filename</cite>.adf.1 -s 0 -e 39</code></li>
  <li><code>lha a <cite>filename</cite>1.lha <cite>filename</cite>.adf.1</code></li>
  <li><code>delete <cite>filename</cite>.adf.1</code></li>
  <li><code>transdisk &gt;RAM:<cite>filename</cite>.adf.2 -s 40 -e 79</code></li>
  <li><code>lha a <cite>filename</cite>2.lha <cite>filename</cite>.adf.2</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You can concatenate the file in a Windows command prompt:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>copy /y /b <cite>filename</cite>.adf.1+<cite>filename</cite>.adf.2 <cite>filename</cite>.adf</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>DMS</h3>
<p><a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/arc/dms111">DMS</a>, available from
Aminet, is an old Amiga program to read Amiga disks to disk images and compress
them at the same time. You can uncompress the files back to an ADF file using
DMS under WinUAE.</p>

<p>Suppose again that the resulting DMS file is too large. You can split it
like so:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>dms read <cite>filename</cite>-1.dms from DF0: LOW 0 HIGH 39</code></li>
	<li><code>dms read <cite>filename</cite>-2.dms from DF0: LOW 40 HIGH 79</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You can recombine like so:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>dms write <cite>filename</cite>-1.dms to DF0: LOW 0 HIGH 39</code></li>
	<li><code>dms write <cite>filename</cite>-2.dms to DF0: LOW 40 HIGH 79</code></li>
</ul>

<p>As splitting and recombining is a lot of effort, you should try
something other than CrossDOS if possible.</p>

<h2>Yarr! Pirates!</h2>

<p>It's still frowned upon in some circles, but if your original game
disks are corrupted or unavailable, you can probably find copies
online.</p>

<p>You can, of course, use this to enjoy all the Amiga classics you
missed out on back in the day. Strictly speaking this is software piracy,
but most classic Amiga games publishers are no longer in business
or are disinterested in chasing up copyright on their twenty year old
games. See my list of <a href="amiga-games">recommended Amiga games</a>.</p>
