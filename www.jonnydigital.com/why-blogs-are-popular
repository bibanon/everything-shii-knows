<h1>Why are blogs popular?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>In 1999, video game journalist Scott Sharkey started the website
that would become <a href="http://www.solidsharkey.com/">Solidsharkey.com</a>,
a sort of personal homepage and internet journal. The term 'blog' had
been coined only five months earlier, and wouldn't become ubiquitous
until several years later. Sharkey didn't run a 'blog' - he ran a
website:</p>

<p><blockquote><cite>
"Every once in a while it hits me that I can use this space for whatever
I want. Anything at all. I could use it to post my (nonexistent) prom
pictures, or show how non-conformist I am by bitching about
non-conformism. Maybe I could write a gripping page about Why I Think
Religion Is Bad, or tell you all about this crazy fuckin Nintendo game
I found, dude!<br><br>

Or I could just write the above thinly veiled bitch about why every
other web-diary I've read today bored the hemorrhaging fuck out of me.
Not that mine is any more entertaining right now."
</cite></blockquote></p>

<p>It may not be too grandiose a statement to say that sites like
SolidSharkey.com marked the end of the simple "personal homepage"
and the beginning of the blogging revolution. The individually owned
websites of the mid-1990s have all but disappeared, replaced by
increasingly professional "blogs".</p>

<h2>Why have things changed?</h2>

<p>The Web of 2008 is very different to the Web of 1998, and how
people use the Internet has changed.</p>

<p>The first big change is content management. Prior to web services
like Livejournal and CMS systems like Moveable Type, most websites
were updated by hand. Users needed to know the ins and outs of web
technologies like HTML and FTP, and this restricted access to two
sorts of people: enthusiasts, maintaining their own little slice of
the Internet for its own sake, and entrepreneurs, who could afford
to pay someone to do it for them.</p>

<p>When technology gave every user the means to create websites,
websites were no longer anything special. Suddenly it was the
content that mattered most, not the amount of technical skill or
funding available. We got a sort of division of labour, and now
content specialists rule supreme.</p>

<h2>Why are blogs popular?</h2>

<p>For many reasons, including the psychology of web users and
content creators, the 'blog' is simply a more successful
publishing platform.</p>

<p>Short posts are easily updated, encouraging frequent
updates and regular visitors, cementing the site's numerical
popularity. Where the 1990s personal homepage thrived on
long feature articles or stagnant knowledgebases, the
blog is almost by definition continually refreshed. Like
a newspaper, readers come back time and time again.</p>

<p>"Blog" has become synonymous in the media with "popular,
authoritative website", much like "hacker" has shifted from
"computer enthusiast" to "computer criminal". This doesn't
mean that most blogs are successful - the majority aren't
- but a reflection on the qualities that make a successful
website.</p>

<p>Generally put, a website needs to supply a steady stream
of value to readers if it expects to acquire and retain a
user base. Personal homepages were often updated at the
maintainer's whim, and didn't have guarantees of new content
that modern blog does.</p>

<p>Nor did they guarantee content relevant to the reader's
interests. As blogging became more popular and prominent
blogs emerged, it became clear that a key to remaining a
hit was to adhere to one topic that will appeal to the
same user over and over. Split your content between two
different topics, and you divide your strength.</p>

<p>If Sharkey's site was popular long after blogs overtook
personal homepages, we can attribute it to three main factors.
First, it stuck to one topic, or at least to one general
appeal: sarcastic humour and old videogames. Second, it
updated just often enough to draw readers back. Third, the
webmaster was happy to update the site even before web
advertising became popular.</p>
