<h1>Can the Imperial Transporter be destroyed?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw0VMIBGOkk#t=7m15s">Thiima52's K240 playthrough video against the Tylarans</a>, I was surprised to see the Imperial Transporter
hit by a Static Inducer. This raised a good question: Can the Imperial
Transporter be destroyed?</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The Imperial Transporter in K240 is a trade ship which warps in periodically
and stays for several days to purchase ore. When it warps out, you are paid for
the ore you loaded onto it. You can't control the Imperial Transporter, nor can
you check its remaining armour value. The ship will stay around even during an
enemy attack, and is believed by some to be invulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>What I wanted to know was, can it really be killed, and if so, how?</p>

<h2>Nuclear attack</h2>

<p>I created a save state in <a href="winuae">WinUAE</a> in which the Imperial
Transporter had arrived at one of my asteroids. From this save position I tested
various permutations of nuclear missile attack on the colony. It's known that
nuclear missiles can damage ships in orbit.</p>

<p><b>Result: Success!</b> A nuclear missile barrage was successful at destroying
the Imperial Transporter, in some cases.</p>

<p>In one test, the ship survived three nuclear missile strikes at the asteroid,
while in another it was destroyed after one hit. All other surviving ships were
at full armour. It therefore appears that a nuclear missile doesn't deal normal
damage to ships, but has a random chance of destroying each ship in orbit,
including the Imperial Transporter.</p>

<h2>Enemy ships</h2>

<p>However, it's possible that the Imperial Transporter is still invulnerable
to enemy ships. There are two possibilities. One is that the enemy ships
are coded not to target the Imperial Transporter. Another is that they deal no
damage. I have yet to test for this case.</p>

<h2>What happens when the Imperial Transporter is destroyed with ore on board?</h2>

<p>Interestingly, the game has not prepared for the Imperial Transporter's
destruction. The ship still warps out with the green effect, and you still
receive payment for ore. K240 still gives you the five day warning to finish
loading ore. This still occurs even if the asteroid is destroyed with a Mega
missile.</p>
