<h1>Recommended Amiga games</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>The following are a few Amiga games I recommend. See also my
guide on <a href="winuae">how to set up WinUAE</a>, an Amiga
emulator for Windows.</p>

<h2>Platform games</h2>

<p><b>Myth</b> is an excellent platform game that takes the hero
through worlds themed on various mythologies: Greek, Norse, and
Egyptian. Special to this game is that it uses primarily melee
weapons, unlike most platform games which use laser guns or the
like, and the player can switch between weapons.</p>

<p><b>Ruff 'n' Tumble</b> is a fun platform shooter with excellent
gameplay, graphics and music. You shoot robots with a laser gun
of some sort while collecting marbles. You can shoot forward,
upward and diagonally. Powerups increase the maximum of your
gun's power bar, which depletes quickly with time (for power-up
guns you pick up) or depletes as you fire, regenerates when you
stop, and penalizes your gun's rate of fire when low (for your
regular gun). There's an element of strategy as you choose
between extending your powerup gun duration and extending
your regular gun's power when the powerup gun runs out.</p>

<p><b>Soccer Kid</b> is a game where your weapon is a football
(soccer ball). Soccer Kid can perform a fantastic array of
skillful trick kicks in order to hit opponents, pick up items
or catapult himself upward. His goal is to collect his missing
football cards as he traverses the world to find the five
pieces of the World Cup (stolen by an alien, of course), and
he has to find it on time for the 1994 World Cup. A particularly
nice touch is that you can choose Soccer Kid's strip colour.</p>

<h2>Shootemups</h2>

<p><b>Apidya</b> is a side-scrolling shootemup where you control
a wasp, battling against other insects, spiders and garden
wildlife. It's one of the best shootemups on the Amiga and is
produced by Team 17, who later went on to make Worms. Apidya
more or less assumes you'll own an autofire joystick. Apidya
has been released free to download at
<a href="http://www.dream17.co.uk/downloads.php?cat=1">Dream17</a>.</p>

<p><b>Deluxe Galaga</b> is a top-down scrolling Galaga clone
which regularly appears on top Amiga game lists even though it's
a free public domain game rather than a commercial release.
The author has since released a PC and Mac version named
<a href="http://www.warblade.as/">Warblade</a>.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p><b>UFO: Enemy Unknown</b> (in the US: X-Com: UFO Defense)
is a turn-based, squad-based strategy game in which you control
troops who raid UFO landing sites for technology to use against
an impending alien invasion. Like Master of Orion II, UFO has
both tactical combat and a significant research and resource
management aspect as you reverse-engineer, produce and sell
alien technology. What particularly appeals to me is that you
start out with only 20th Century technology (the game begins
in 1999) and research or reverse-engineer advanced technologies
yourself. The DOS version
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/7760/">is available
to buy on Steam</a>.</p>

<p><b>K240</b> is a real-time space colonization game in which
you compete with aliens to establish mining colonies on asteroids.
Your weapons include missiles and ships, both of which require
certain ore to produce, and what minerals you don't use can
be sold back to the empire. You can buy hi-tech blueprints
for new buildings, weapons, or upgrades to existing technologies.
K240 has slightly dystopian undertones (which may be
unintentional): workers sometimes escape on a stolen ship,
or stage a revolt, requiring security centres to be built;
citizen morale is otherwise no concern of the player.
K240 was re-released on the <cite>Best of Gremlin</cite> CD
in 2000.</p>
