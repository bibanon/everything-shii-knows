<h1>K240 CU Amiga coverdisk K240 demo</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>CU Amiga Magazine March 94 presented Coverdisk #77, a demo of
Gremlin Games' upcoming asteroid colonization game,
<a href="k240">K240</a>. The demo has a few differences with
the game's final release.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play begins mid-game. You have over three million credits,
      a large asteroid, many buildings, several ships, and the
      blueprints to Missile Guidance System. Your opponent is
      always the KLL-KP-QUA.</li>
  <li>You can see alien colonies without a spy satellite.</li>
  <li>Several features are disabled. You can't build missiles,
      ships, spy satellites, or an Orbital Space Dock. You can't
      start a new colony, order blueprints, destroy buildings,
      load ore on your transporter, or sell ore to the Imperial
      Transporter. Fleets can't intercept other fleets.</li>
  <li>The sprites for the Construction Yard, Environment Control,
      and Protected Environment Control are different to the
      final version.</li>
  <li>You don't receive a cash bonus for discovering an asteroid,
      discovering an alien asteroid, or wiping out an alien
      colony. You don't receive income based on your population
      or number of colonies.</li>
  <li>Due to a bug, you can fire the enemy's missiles at himself.
      Another bug let you fire more missiles than the number
      at the asteroid by changing the number while missiles
      are firing. You can see
      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RT6RDBGiQk">Thiima52's
      Youtube video of these bugs in action</a>.</li>
  <li>Speech is disabled.</li>
  <li>A few minor text changes. Power Amplifier was called
      Power Doubler. A hit from a Mega missile gave the message
      "A COLONY ASTEROID HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY A DEEP SPACE MISSILE",
      rather than "A COLONY ASTEROID HAS BEEN DESTROYED, BLOWN TO
      PIECES!"</li>
  <li>Pressing 'V' doesn't reveal the game's version number.</li>
  <li>Cheats are not enabled in this version. The game executable
      contains the cheat-related strings "ENTER HELP CODE:",
      "ENTER SHIP 1-7:", and "ENTER SFX A-Z:", but disassembly
      suggests the help codes themselves were removed from the
      demo.</li>
</ul>
