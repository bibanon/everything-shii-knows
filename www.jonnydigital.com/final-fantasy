<h1> Final Fantasy Numbering System Guide </h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->


<p>
As a kid, I was both amused and confused by the television advertisments
for Final Fantasy VII. Amused, because this game series had apparently
broken its label of "final" six times already, yet confused - if this game
was popular enough to warrant such a long-running series, how come I'd
never heard of the previous six? Furthermore, nobody I talked to had heard
of Final Fantasy four through six.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that several not only were Final Fantasy games were released
only in Japan, but several of the Final Fantasy games released had their
name changed for the English-language release. Two of the Final Fantasy
NES/SNES games were renumbered, while the Final Fantasy gameboy games
weren't even part of the Final Fantasy series in Japan to begin with.
Here's the full list.
</p>

<h2>NES/Famicom Games</h2>

<p>
<b>Final Fantasy</b> was released in Japan for the NES (which in Japan
is known as the Famicom). It's said that the reason for the name Final
Fantasy was that Squaresoft's games just weren't getting popular back
then, they believed Final Fantasy would be their final game. It was
unexpectedly popular, warranting and English-language release and a
number of sequels. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Final Fantasy II and III</b> were later released in Japan for the
Famicom (NES), but were never officially translated to English. These
are totally different to the SNES games released in America as Final
Fantasy II/III (see below). More recently, fans have since translated
the ROMs into English. Screenshots:

Fantasy II</a>,
<a href="images/image=the-world-is-square.png">Final Fantasy III</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Final Fantasy I and II were later re-released together on the
Playstation as Final Fantasy Origins</i>.
</p>

<h2>SNES/Super Famicom Games</h2>

<p>
<b>Final Fantasy IV</b> was the first Final Fantasy game released
for the SNES (known in Japan as the Super Famicom). To suit both 
veteran Final Fantasy fans as well as new players, two versions of
the game were released: <i>Final Fantasy IV Easytype</i>, and <i>Final
Fantasy IV Hardtype</i>, with Easytype appealing to newbies and Hardtype
appealing to fans who liked a challenge. Easytype was released as
<i>Final Fantasy II</i> in the US.
</p>

<p>
<b>Final Fantasy V</b> is possibly the best game of the series, and
was one of the most popular in Japan, yet for some unfathomable
reason it wasn't given an English release. FF5 sees. Instead, we got...
</p>

<p>
<b>Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest</b>, a simpler game which is nowhere
near as enjoyable as FF5. Contrary to some suggestions, it is a "true"
Final Fantasy game, being released in Japan under the name <i>Final
Fantasy USA</i>. Screenshots: <a href="http://www.vgmuseum.com/images/snes01/01/ffmq.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Final Fantasy VI</b> competes with FFV as the best Final Fantasy
game in many peoples' opinions, and was released in the US as
<i>Final Fantasy III</i>. FF6 is the one featuring Kefka, Terra,
Locke and the Magitek Armor, and is a pretty spiffy game all-round.
Later, this game was given a PSX release, where it was given its
correct name (Final Fantasy VI) as well as some spiffy new FMVs.
</p>

<p>
<i>In the US, Final Fantasy IV was rereleased on the on the
Playstation along with Chrono Trigger as
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005LOXE/jonnydigital-20">Final Fantasy Chronicles</a>,
while Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI were released together
as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00002R28C/jonnydigital-20">Final Fantasy Anthology</a>.
However, in the UK, Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V were released as
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000065VUV/jonnydigital-21">Final Fantasy Anthology</a>,
while <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006340X/jonnydigital-21">Final Fantasy VI</a>
was released seperately, with a free demo of Final Fantasy X.</i>
</p>


<h2>Gameboy</h2>

<p>
None of the Gameboy releases of Final Fantasy were actually true
Final Fantasy games - that is, they were not named "Final Fantasy"
when first released in Japan. <b>Final Fantasy Adventure</b> was
actually <i>Seiken Densetsu</i>, while <b>Final Fantasy Legend 1-3</b>
was actually the first three games of the <i>SaGa</i> series.
Technically, this means that they weren't real Final Fantasy games,
merely having the Final Fantasy game added to it for the English
language release in order to benefit from the Final Fantasy series'
popularity.
</p>


<p>
Interestingly, according to
<a href="http://www.fantasyanime.com/saga/fflabout.htm">this website</a>,
<i>Romancing SaGa 1-3</i> on the SNES was actually <i>SaGa 4-6</i> in Japan,
while the Playstation's <i>Saga Frontier</i> was Japan's <i>SaGa 7</i>.
</p>


<h2>Playstation/Playstation 2/GBA/Gamecube</h2>

<p>
<b>Final Fantasy VII</b> onward retained the correct Japanese numbering system.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
If you fell asleep halfway through, here's a condensed of it.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Final Fantasy was originally made in Japan but was later released
    on the NES in America</li>
  <li>The American release of "Final Fantasy II" on the SNES was originally
    called <i>Final Fantasy VI Easytype</i> (4) in Japan</li>
  <li>The American relese of "Final Fantasy III" on the SNES, likewise,
    was originally called <i>Final Fantasy VI</i> (6) in Japan</li>
  <li>All the Final Fantasy Gameboy games were just other games with the
    name changed to Final Fantasy when they translated them</li>
  <li>Finally, there were two Final Fantasy games on the NES and another
    on the SNES that did not get English language releases - in the Japanese
    numbering system these were FF2, FF3 and FF5.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Where can I get these games?</h2>

<p>
Final Fantasy I and II were re-released as <i>Final Fantasy Origins</i> on
the Playstation. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008K7BS/jonnydigital-21">Click here</a>
to buy it in the UK, or
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008RUYZ/jonnydigital-20">here</a>
to buy from the US.
</p>

<p>
Final Fantasy III was never released, but a version of it has
been translated into English by fans of the series. You may be
able to find it downloadable online, playable by a NES emulator
such as NESticle. Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest and the Final Fantasy
Gameboy games are no longer on sale, but if you find ROMs of them
somewhere online, they are playable via a SNES emulator such as ZSNES
or a Gameboy emulator such as NO$GMB.
</p>

<p>
If you're in America, you can buy Final Fantasy IV as
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005LOXE/jonnydigital-20">Final Fantasy Chronicles</a>,
and both Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI as
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00002R28C/jonnydigital-20">Final Fantasy Anthology</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you're in the UK, you can buy Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V
as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000065VUV/jonnydigital-21">Final Fantasy Anthology</a>,
and also <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006340X/jonnydigital-21">Final Fantasy VI</a>.
I highly recommend buying both 5 and 6, as they are among the finest games in the series.</i>
