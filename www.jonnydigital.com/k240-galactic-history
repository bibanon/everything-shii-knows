<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<dl>
  <dt>9th century</dt>
  <dd>Human invent explosives.</dd>
  
  <dt>1775<dt>
  <dd>M53 globular cluster discovered by Terran astronomer
  Johann Elert Bode. Unknown to the Terrans, this is
  home to an alien race known as the Lak'Maj'Traal.</dd>
  
  <dt>1945</dt>
  <dd>Humans develop nuclear weapons.</dd>
  
  <dt>Before 2215</dt>
  <dd>Humans develop faster-than-light drive, and colonize
  other planets. Overcrowding becomes a problem for the
  human race.</dd>

  <dt>2215<dt>
  <dd>Command of the homeworlds (the most densely populated worlds
  nearest to Earth) seized by Commander of the Fleet Parillo,
  during the five year war at Deneb Markab. Parillo promises
  to push out in search of new worlds in order to ease
  overcrowding. Over the next 35 years, Parillo discovers and
  opens up new worlds for colonization, and establishes the
  Industrial Worlds which concentrate industry away from
  population areas and maximize productivity.</dd>
  
  <dt>2221</dt>
  <dd>Tetracorp founded as a manufacturer of scout ships and sensory
  equipment for the Imperial Fleet.</dd>
  
  <dt>2232</dt>
  <dd>Assault Fighter ship developed by the Kerell Corporation,
  based on the Industrial World of Tau Ceti III. Its designer is
  Ms. L.G.R. Ruley, Engineer Grade VII; unusually, the only
  female engineer ever to hold a senior position at Kerell.</dd>
  
  <dt>2253</dt>
  <dd>Parillo formally declared Emperor.</dd>
  
  <dt>2274</dt>
  <dd>Emperor Parillo dies. His son, Marcissus, inherits the
  throne. He continues his father's expansionist policies, but
  his xenophobic nature leads to many wars with newly-discovered
  alien races, many of whom are highly advanced and capable of
  inflicting serious damage on the Imperial Fleet.</dd>

  <dt>2278</dt>
  <dd>Destructor ship developed by Gax Industries at the Gax
  R&amp;D facility on Brekon 7. The designer is Y. Inara, also
  known  for designing the fault-ridden Gax Transporter. The
  Destructor was never built, and would not become operational
  for another 38 years.</dd>

  <dt>Before 2280</dt>
  <dd>Terran Empire first identifies the Rigellian species.</dd>

  <dt>2280</dt>
  <dd>Tetracorp, grows to own and fill the entire Industral World
  of Barnard Five.</dd>
  
  <dt>2294<dt>
  <dd>The Tharmaxlons declare war on the Terran Empire. The
  Decade of Terror begins, during which the Tharmaxlons open
  a great gash in the side of the empire nearest their
  homeworlds in the Capella sector.</dd>
  
  <dt>2301</dt>
  <dd>The Tharmaxlons penetrate to the heart of the Empire,
  and destroy the Industrial Worlds orbiting Beta Hydrae.
  Marcissus is blamed for his refusal to enter into
  peace negotiations with the aliens.</dd>
  
  <dt>2303</dt>
  <dd>Marcissus deposed as emperor. Lynn Salaria, his daughter
  and greatest critic, crowned Empress. Her first act is to
  push back the Tharmaxlons with all the Imperial might.
  She later negotiates a treaty with the Tharmaxlons, which
  is very preferential to the Terran Empire.</dd>
  
  <dt>2308</dt>
  <dd>Combat Eagle ship developed by the Morgan Design
  Institute on Barnard Five, under license to Tetracorp.
  Its designer is engineer and pilot R.F. Drake-Stoker.
  It later becomes Tetracorp's standard low-cost
  assault ship and widely used throughout the empire.</dd>
  
  <dt>2309</dt>
  <dd>Sci-Tek founded. Its first products are the Asteroid
  Engines and Gravity Nullifier.</dd>
  
  <dt>2316</dt>
  <dd>The Destructor ship, initially designed in 2278,
  finishes undergoing a redesign and finally becomes
  operational. A versatile vessel, it becomes a popular
  leading attack and support ship.</dd>
  
  <dt>2319</dt>
  <dd>Sci-Tek leads the way in design and manufacture of
  new technologies. Sci-Tek's legal department devises a
  complex licensing agreement for the design blueprints
  of their technologies. This policy is a huge financial
  success, and Sci-Tek later phases out its manufacturing
  facilities to concentrate on development.</dd>
  
  <dt>2321</dt>
  <dd>Terminator ship developed and built by Sci-Tek.
  The designer is not recorded.</dd>
  
  <dt>2330</dt>
  <dd>Ten light years out of space dock, a Terran ship
  is destroyed when the shields fail during a routine
  cleanup sweep in the Fragmented Sectors. All crew
  are lost. Sabotage is suspected, but never proven. See file
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRwIjD0DGA">Syracuse
  UFF-145A</a>.
  
  <dt>2338</dt>
  <dd>The Orbital Space Dock is developed by the
  Morgan Design Institute on Barnard Five. The designer is
  M.D. Glossop. Initiallly designed as a control post in
  the Frontier Sectors, the Orbital Space Dock originally
  had larger cargo bays, but were altered at the last
  minute into a construction facility for large warships.</dd>
  
  <dt>2345</dt>
  <dd>Scout Ship developed at the Tetracorp Centra Construction
  Yards on Barnard Five. Its designer is engineer R. Marax.
  Later It later becomes popular among Tetracorp franchised
  mining operations and the Imperial Navy.</dd>

  <dt>Mid-24th century</dt>
  <dd>Having developed new technique for extracting and
  transporting rare ores mined in deep space, Tetracorp corners
  the market in mining franchises. Tetracorp offers mining
  packages in the Fragmented Sectors, star systems discovered
  at the edge of the empire whose plants have been torn apart
  to produce huge, easily mined asteroid fields. Tetracorp
  begins to offer equipment and support in exchange for a degree
  of control over colonies and full rights to purchase all ore
  at standard Imperial prices.</dd>

  <dt>2364</dt>
  <dd>Fleet Battleship developed by Sci-Tek. The designer
  is R. Giggs. Both Sci-Tek and Tetracorp come to recommend
  this vessel as their primary warship.</dd>
  
  <dt>2371</dt>
  <dd>Fifty years after the release of the original Terminator,
  Sci-Tek releases the Terminator version 5. Its designer
  is I. Atkin, considered by many to be one of the greatest
  naval architects the galaxy has ever seen.</dd>
  
  <dt>2380</dt>
  <dd>Current day. The Terran Empire now governs a vast
  area of space, a sphere approximately 300 light years in
  radius with Earth at its centre, and including countless
  billions of humans on over 1,000 worlds. Tetracorp makes
  Sector K240 available for colonization. K240 is one of
  the Fragmented Sectors, and occupies a cube of space
  50 light years across. The Empress is expected to
  abdicate in favour of her son within a few years.
  (K240 begins.)</dd>
  
  <dt>2437</dt>
  <dd>A coup deposes Terran Emperor Dramon Salaria.
  [Fragile Allegiance]</dd>
  
  <dt>2439</dt>
  <dd>The Federation is established to encourage commercial
  competition rather than full scale war between its members.
  Six alien cultures form members: the Terrans, the Artemia,
  the Mikotaj, the Achean Gatherings, the Braccatia, and the
  Rigellians. A seventh race, the Mauna, is excluded from the
  Federation. [Fragile Allegiance]</dd>
  
  <dt>2496</dt>
  <dd>(Fragile Allegiance begins.)</dd>
