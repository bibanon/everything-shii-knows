<h1>Ode to an Amiga</h1>

<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p><cite>by Jonathan Drain, age 14, August 1997</cite></p>

<p>"What is the best, Amiga or PC?"<br>
My friends are forever asking me,<br>
I usually have the same reply,<br>
"The PC", I tell them, with a bit of a sigh.</p>

<p>I know that I'm wrong, and I'm glad that it's so,<br>
I'd like to upgrade, but I don't have the dough.<br>
People judge the Amiga by what they can see,<br>
I don't have the cash for a 4000T.</p>

<p>"Get a PC" they tell me, "Amigas are dead",<br>
That's what those so-called "friends" of mine said,<br>
I can't really blame them, but, in the end,<br>
I don't have a lot of spare money to spend.</p>

<p>An Amiga 600, no more and no less,<br>
Sits in my room on its cold metal desk,<br>
All by itself, it's a sad thing to see,<br>
I had no other choice but to get a PC.</p>

<p>Without the old clich&eacute; - "Abort Retry Fail",<br>
The PC is ten on a one to five scale,<br>
"Eight point Three" filenames you no longer see,<br>
Except using CrossDos, in old Workbench 3.</p>

<p>Give us a hard drive, I'm sure we're all sick<br>
Of all those requestors, what are we, thick?<br>
Nobody likes that old screen to arrive,<br>
"Please insert Workbench in any disk drive."</p>

<p>I know, we do have the best PD Scene,<br>
But sadly, it's not quite what it might have been.<br>
Amigas are brilliant, but still, more and more,<br>
I find myself reaching for Left-Alt F4.</p>

<p>Amigas are cheaper, but people will stake<br>
That little bit more for Duke Nukem and Quake.<br>
So much for the Paula, as nice as it's been,<br>
It's just not as good as Soundblaster 16.</p>

<p>I can't read the Times without seeing an ad<br>
For some kind of PC, it's really that bad,<br>
The PC looks like it's got three treble-tops,<br>
With zero Amigas on sale in the shops.</p>

<p>It's mail order only, though Eyetech and Power<br>
Have done a good job with their 1200 Tower<br>
The hardware might be just the thing to enhance<br>
But without the right software, it hasn't a chance.</p>

<p>No more mistakes, you must get it right<br>
Or Amigas are losing a pitiful fight,<br>
Amigas's great father is now, sadly, gone,<br>
But Jay Miner's legacy still lingers on.</p>

<p>Amigas have suffered a whole lot of pain,<br>
But put in the effort, we'll thrive once again.<br>
We'll know that we've really caught up with the bus,<br>
When Microsoft want to make software for us!</p>
