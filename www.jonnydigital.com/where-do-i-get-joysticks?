<h1>Where do I get joysticks for my Amiga?</h1>

<p>If you own an Amiga or similar machine, you have at some point
owned a small cache of broken joysticks. Those jet fighter style
Quickshot controllers looked pretty awesome in the nineties, but
were terribly prone to breakage. One of the few survivors is the
Competition Pro, the defining image of the joystick with the big
red buttons on a black base and the red-ball stick - but good luck
finding someone willing to part with theirs.</p>

<p>I was pretty excited, then, to hear that Individual Computers
and Speedlink had <a href="http://amigakit.leamancomputing.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=52&products_id=657">put the Competition Pro</a>
back into production. This is good news for Amiga owners looking
to replace worn-out joysticks. The Atari, Commodore 64 and Amstrad
used the same joystick standard as the Amiga, and should be
compatible with this.</p>

<p>A site called <a href="http://www.amigakit.com">AmigaKit.com</a>
supplies the replica Competition Pro joystick, along with a USB
version for PC use, and other handy Amiga-related hardware.</p>

<h2>Competition Pro: Is it any good?</h2>

<p>I own two of the Amiga joysticks and one of the PC joysticks,
and I have to say that they're pretty good. You have four fire
buttons, all of which (on the Amiga version at least) do the same
thing. The switch on the back is not an autofire, but enables or
disables the smaller fire buttons in case you want to hold the
joystick at that point and use the larger buttons instead.</p>

<p>The connector was a tight fit in my A1200's port, but worked
fine. However, it lacks the special features of those snazzy
Quickshot controllers such as trigger buttons and autofire;
good luck playing games like Apidya which were specifically
designed for autofire controllers.</p>

<p>The USB version works just fine for playing <a href="http://kayin.pyoko.org/iwbtg/">I Wanna Be The Guy</a>
and under WinUAE. It's silver and blue rather than the
traditional red and black, and differs from the Amiga version
in that all four fire buttons are separate function, as on a
Megadrive or Playstation controller. The switch at the back
also functions as an autofire.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>I previously bought two used Amiga Quickshot joysticks
on eBay. One doesn't move right, the other doesn't fire.
I put them in the cupboard with "doesn't move left",
"trigger doesn't work" and "doesn't work at all". Your
mileage may vary.</p>

<p>The interoperability between consoles means that Atari
2600 / 7800 or Sega Megadrive / Master System /Genesis
controllers will work for the Amiga, although most games
won't support the Sega joypad's extra buttons. Broken
controllers are often possible to repair, if you've got
some time and a solder iron (or even some tin foil and
tape).</p>

<p>For PC users willing to emulate an Amiga, you've got more
options available. You can find USB adaptors for both old
and modern game controllers, including Sega Megadrive and
Playstation 2 joypads. You can also find new PC joysticks,
although these tend to be analogue sticks where the consoles
of old are expecting digital, so it's not always a perfect
match.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I heartily recommend the Competition Pro remake as a
replacement for your broken Amiga or Atari joysticks, and
its USB counterpart for those of us who use an emulator
or just want to play <cite>IWBTG</cite> the authentic
old-fashioned way.</p>
