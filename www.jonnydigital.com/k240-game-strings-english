018c  THIS DEVICE MODIFIES ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE GENERATORS THAT RELY UPON HARNESSING THE SUN'S POWER. IT DOUBLES ALL POWER OUTPUT FROM THOSE GENERATORS.
018d  THIS DEVICE IS A REAL BREAKTHROUGH. IT MODIFIES ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE TURRETS. THEIR DAMAGE CAPABILITY IS DOUBLED, WITHOUT USING MORE POWER.
018e  THESE ARE PUT TO WORK IN YOUR CONSTRUCTION YARDS, ENABLING THEM TO CONSTRUCT TWICE AS MANY SHIPS AS BEFORE.
018f  A NEW LOADING RACK SYSTEM ENABLES YOU TO STORE TWICE AS MANY MISSILES ON EACH ASTEROID, YET STILL LOAD AND LAUNCH THEM AT THE SAME RATE.
0190  AN ENHANCEMENT IN POWER STORAGE TECHNIQUES DOUBLES THE CAPACITY OF ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE POWER STORES.
0191  THIS MULTI-HEADED DRILL BIT WILL DOUBLE THE OUTPUT OF ALL YOUR MINES, BOTH EXISTING AND FUTURE.
0192  DEPOSITS A SUBSTANCE THAT SPREADS RAPIDLY ACROSS THE TARGET ASTEROID. IT DESTROYS ANY STRUCTURE THAT IT CONTACTS. ORE NEEDED:
      1 TRAXIUM.
0193  A VERY EFFECTIVE WARSHIP. IT HAS GREATER ARMOUR THAN EXISTING SHIPS AND FOUR HARDPOINTS FOR MOUNTING WEAPONS.
0194  THE MOST POWERFUL WARSHIP AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. AT 92M LONG, IT HAS THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY ABOARD, AND SIX WEAPON HARDPOINTS.
0195  (HARDPOINT) OFFERS TOTAL PROTECTION AGAINST ATTACK. IT CANNOT BE MAINTAINED PERMANENTLY, BUT IS PULSED ON AND OFF AT REGULAR INTERVALS.
0196  (HARDPOINT) IT EMITS A POWERFUL E.M. BEAM TO SCRAMBLE THE ELECTRONICS OF AN ENEMY SHIP, RENDERING IT TEMPORARILY VULNERABLE TO ALL ATTACKS.
0197  (HARDPOINT) IT ENERGISES THE HULL TO DEFLECT MOST OF THE ENERGY OF AN ATTACK. CAN BE USED WITH EXISTING SHIELDS.
0198  THOUGH THIS DEVICE FILLS AN ENTIRE SHIP HARDPOINT, IT PROVIDES THE SHIP WITH GREATER ARMOUR.
0199  SCI-TEK ENGINEERS WILL INSTALL SENSORS IN ALL YOUR ASTEROIDS, REMOVING THE NEED FOR SENSOR ARRAYS.
019a  THIS DEVICE MONITORS AND TRACKS ALL KNOWN ASTEROIDS. THEIR PATHS AND SPEEDS WILL BE DISPLAYED ON YOUR TACTICAL VIEW OF THE ASTEROID FIELD.
019b  THIS DEVICE ACCURATELY MEASURES THE DISTANCE TO THE TARGET ASTEROID AND OFFERS AN ESTIMATE OF THE CHANCE OF THE MISSILES SUCCESSFULLY HITTING.
019c  THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE LATEST HARDENED CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. ALL YOUR FUTURE BUILDINGS WILL BENEFIT FROM A GREATER RESILIENCE TO ATTACK.
019d  MONEY =

01a2  THE IMPERIAL TRANSPORTER HAS BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING BLUEPRINTS:
01a3  YOU OWN THE FOLLOWING BLUEPRINTS:
01a4  PAGE:     /
01a5  A SCAN OF THE TECHNICAL DATABASES REVEAL THAT THE ABOVE BLUEPRINT HAS BEEN STOLEN AND DELETED FROM THE DATABASE. WE SUSPECT THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ATTEMPTING TO SABOTAGE YOUR OPERATIONS. THIS IS SERIOUS - THAT BLUEPRINT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE!
01a6  COLONY NOT YET ESTABLISHED!
01a7  NO DESTINATION TELEPORTER SPECIFIED!
01a8  DESTINATION HAS NO ORE TELEPORTER!
01a9  SOURCE ASTEROID STORES FULL!
01aa  DESTINATION ASTEROID STORES FULL!
01ab  DIRECTS A FLEET OF DROIDS THAT MOVE ABOUT THE COLONY AND REPAIR DAMAGED BUILDINGS AND SPACECRAFT.
01ac  YOU HAVE NO COMMAND CENTRES!
01ad  AX-ZILANTH'S
01ae  (BETA HYDRAE IV)
01af  NEWLY ARRIVED IN SECTOR K240. DISCOVERED IN THE CAPELLA SECTOR, THEY HAVE PROVEN HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE AND CAPABLE OF GREAT CUNNING.
01b0  [ DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM ]
01b1  LAK'MAJ'TRAAL
      (ORE-EATERS)
01b2  (M53 GALAXY)
01b3  FROM THE GALAXY IN SAGITTARIUS. THEY MOVE SWIFTLY BETWEEN SECTORS, STRIPPING PLANETS OF MINERALS AND METALS. THEY HAVE LAID WASTE EVERY SECTOR IN THEIR HOME GALAXY.
01b4  THE RIGELLIAN CONFEDERATION
01b5  (RIGEL SYSTEM)
01b6  AN ANCIENT AND HIGHLY ADVANCED CULTURE WHO REFUSE ALL ATTEMPTS TO OPEN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEM. SUSPECTED DEADLY.
01b7  [ DIFFICULTY: HARD ]
01b8  KLL-KP-QUA
01b9  (TAU CETI III)
01ba  LIKE TERRAN INSECTS, THEY OPERATE AS A HIVE INTELLIGENCE, PROTECTING THEIR EGG-LAYING QUEEN. THEIR ACTIONS ARE VERY PREDICTABLE.
01bb  [ DIFFICULTY: EASY ]
01bc  TYLARAN EMPIRE
01bd  (DENEB MIRA III)
01be  DISCOVERED SOME TIME AGO, THEY HAVE ONLY RECENTLY ATTAINED THE STARSHIP TECHNOLOGY TO REACH OUR FRONTIER SECTORS. GREEDY AND SELFISH, BUT OTHERWISE A LIMITED THREAT.
01bf  SWIXARANS
01c0  (CORE SYSTEMS)
01c1  ABANDONING THEIR HOMEWORLDS AT THE CENTRE OF THE GALAXY, THEY ARE SEARCHING SECTOR K240 FOR NEW WORLDS. ADVANCED AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
01c2  ASTEROID STRUCTURE TOO WEAK!
