<h1>Pok&eacute;ball capture rate guide</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>As of <cite>Pok&eacute;mon Black &amp; White</cite>, 26 types of
Pok&eacute;balls appear in the main Pok&eacute;mon game series, of
which 15 are normally available in Black and White. The same 15 are
available in Diamond, Pearl and Platinum, with 7 further apricorn
balls in HeartGold &amp; SoulSilver.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of special Pok&eacute;balls is never given in
game. <a href="http://veekun.com/dex/gadgets/pokeballs">Eevee's Pok&eacute;ball performance calculator</a>
is useful for calculating the exact catch rate under specific
circumstances.</p>

<h2>General advice</h2>
<h3>Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Black, White</h3>
<p>Outside of Pok&eacute;mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, the best general use
Pok&eacute;ball is the Dusk Ball. By playing at night (8:00pm - 3:59am),
you always gain the benefit of a 3.5x capture rate, which is actually
superior to the Ultra Ball (2x). The Dive Ball is equally good in water,
but hard to obtain before Black &amp; White.</p>

<p>Only three balls can give a better bonus. The Timer Ball is better than
3.5x after the 26th round of combat, useful for long battles with legendaries.
The Quick Ball is only useful if you're lazy: it's 4x, but that's the same
as paralyzing the opponent and using an Ultra Ball. The Nest Ball below level
5 gives a bonus is 3.6x-3.9x, but most Pok&eacute;mon of that level are easily
caught in any ball.</p>

<p>If you aren't playing at night, Repeat Ball gives you 3x on any Pok&eacute;mon
you already have, and Net Ball gives 3x on anything Bug or Water type.
After that, nothing below Ultra Ball is worth using except for happiness
evolution (Golbat in a Luxury Ball) or novelty (Chansey in a Heal Ball,
legendaries in Premier Balls).</p>

<h3>HeartGold and SoulSilver</h3>

<p>All the DPPt/BW advice applies to HG/SS, except that apricorn balls are
superior in some circumstances.</p>

<p>Heavy Ball is the best in the game, but only for certain exceptionally
heavy legendaries: Lugia and the Embedded Tower trio. These get an effective
bonus of 7x-9x due to the unusual way the Heavy Ball works.</p>

<p>Fast Ball beats a Dusk Ball, offering a 4x bonus against 22 available
species (see below), including six legendaries. Moon Ball works likewise for
the six capturable species out of 14 whose lines include Moon Stone evolutions.
Level Ball is a superior Nest Ball, offering 4x to capture Pok&eacute;mon half
your level or lower and 8x at a quarter of your level, useful for late-game
Pok&eacute;dex filling.</p>

<p>Safari Balls are only as good as Great Balls (1.5x). This is why you can't
catch anything.</p>

<h2>Notes on individual Pok&eacute;balls</h2>

<h3>Fast Ball</h3>
<p>Only the following Pok&eacute;mon benefit from the Fast Ball,
being capturable with any Pok&eacute;ball in HeartGold/SoulSilver and
having a base speed stat of 100 or greater:</p>

<p>Dodrio, Dugtrio, Electabuzz, Electrode, Entei, Fearow, Kadabra,
Latias, Latios, Linoone, Lugia, Mewtwo, Miltank, Mismagius,
Persian, Raikou, Rapidash, Sneasel, Tauros, Tentacruel, Voltorb, Zapdos.</p>

<p>In the original Gold, Silver and Crystal, only roaming Pok&eacute;mon
gain benefit from the Fast Ball.</p>

<h3>Heavy Ball</h3>
<p>Only the following Pok&eacute;mon benefit from the Heavy Ball, being
capturable with any Pok&eacute;ball in HeartGold/SoulSilver and having
a weight of 451.5lbs (204.7kg) or greater:</p>

<p>Groudon, Gyarados, Kyogre, Lapras, Lugia, Mantine, Onix, Rayquaza,
Snorlax, Steelix.</p>

<p>Of these, the Heavy Ball is only the best Pok&eacute;ball for
Groudon, Kyogre, Lugia, Rayquaza and Snorlax, as its flat numerical
bonus benefits extremely heavy, difficult to capture Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

<p>The Dusk Ball is still superior to the Heavy Ball for Snorlax at
night (3.5x for Dusk Ball, vs 2.6x for Heavy Ball or 2x for Ultra Ball).
Gyarados, Lapras, Mantine, Onix and Steelix are only found in caves
or water and the Dusk Ball, Dive Ball or Net Ball is superior. Except
for Steelix (2.2x with Heavy Ball), even an Ultra Ball is superior.</p>

<p>All other Pok&eacute;mon are so light that the Heavy Ball actually
has worse performance than a standard Pok&eacute;ball.</p>

<h3>Timer Ball</h3>

<p>Timer Ball takes until the 10th round to equal the Ultra Ball and
25th round to equal the Dusk Ball. It's really only useful for very
long encounters, such as legendaries.</p>
