<h1>Rare Pok&eacute;mon guide</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>This article describes how to obtain Pok&eacute;mon which cannot
be captured normally in any of the Nintendo DS Pok&eacute;mon games, but
which are necessary to obtain a full National Pok&eacute;dex of all
493 or 649 Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

<p>According to Serebii.net,
<a href="http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/unobtainables.shtml">48 Pok&eacute;mon</a>
are unobtainable between Pok&eacute;mon Diamond and Pearl,
<a href="http://www.serebii.net/platinum/missing.shtml">56 Pok&eacute;mon</a> are
unavailable in Platinum, and
<a href="http://www.serebii.net/heartgoldsoulsilver/unobtainable.shtml">42 Pok&eacute;mon</a>
cannot be caught in HeartGold or SoulSilver. Between all five games, only
four Pok&eacute;mon cannot be caught: <b>Celebi</b>, <b>Mew</b>, <b>Jirachi</b>
and <b>Deoxys</b>. Nine others can technically be acquired in-game, but
only in special circumstances: <b>Regigigas</b>, <b>Regirock</b>, <b>Regice</b>,
<b>Registeel</b>, <b>Phione</b>, <b>Manaphy</b>, <b>Darkrai</b>, <b>Shaymin</b>,
and <b>Arceus</b>.</p>

<p>Between Pok&eacute;mon Black and White, only six new Pok&eacute;mon can
not be caught normally: <b>Victini</b>, <b>Keldeo</b>, <b>Meloetta</b>,
<b>Genesect</b>, <b>Zorua</b>, and <b>Zoroark</b>.</p>

<h2>Acquiring legendary Pok&eacute;mon</h2>

<p>Several of the legendary Pok&eacute;mon were distributed by event. This list
assumes you missed the event, otherwise you already have that Pok&eacute;mon.
This list is accurate as of 9th April 2011.</p>

		item in Diamond, Pearl or Platinum.</dd>
	<dt>Celebi</dt>
	<dd><em>Acquire from other game</em>. Celebi was distributed with the Japanese
		Pok&eacute;mon Colosseum bonus disc. Must be transferred to a Japanese copy
		a Pok&eacute;mon GBA game, then onto a Japanese Pok&eacute;mon DS game.</dd>
	<dt>Darkrai</dt>
	<dd><em>Unavailable without cheating</em>. Use a Wonder card generator to cheat for the Member Card
		item in Diamond, Pearl or Platinum. Or, use "tweaking" glitch to access
		Newmoon Island. Or, cheat somehow to unlock the mission "Liberate the Tower!" in
		Pok&eacute;mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia.</dd>

		Channel in Europe and Australia. Must be transferred via an English language
		copy of Ruby or Sapphire. Jirachi is regularly distributed each year in Japan
		and sometimes outside of Japan to celebrate Tanabata.</dd>
	<dt>Keldeo</dt>
	<dd><em>Unavailable</em>.</dd>
	<dt>Manaphy</dt>
	<dd><em>Acquire from other game</em>. A secret mission in Pok&eacute;mon Ranger

		the Old Sea Map item in Pok&eacute;mon Emerald.</dd>
	<dt>Phione</dt>
	<dd><em>Acquire from other game, or GTS</em>. Trade 999 Pok&eacute;mon from
		Pok&eacute;mon Diamond or Pearl to My Pok&eacute;mon Ranch for Wiiware. Or,
		acquire Manaphy, and breed it. Phione can be reliably acquired via Global Trade
		System, as it can breed.</dd>
	<dt>Regigigas</dt>
	<dd><em>Acquire from other game</em>. Bring Regirock, Regice and Registeel to
		Snowpoint Temple in Pok&eacute;mon Diamond, Pearl or Platinum.</dd>

<h2>All Pok&eacute;mon, all formes</h2>

<p>Certain Pok&eacute;mon have alternate formes which cannot be traded, or
revert to their original form when traded.</p>

<p>Obtaining all of Rotom's alternate formes in Platinum requires the Secret Key
item. If you missed the event that distributed this, you will have to cheat to
acquire the Wonder Card to unlock it to add all Rotom's formes to the Pok&eacute;dex
in Platinum. The alternate formes can be acquired in HeartGold and SoulSilver,
but Rotom reverts to its normal forme when traded.</p>

<p>Giratina's Origin Forme in HeartGold and SoulSilver requires it to hold the
Griseous Orb, an item which cannot be traded. The only way to acquire it is to
bring an event Arceus to HG/SS and use this to create a Giratina, who will be
holding the orb. The Griseous Orb is available in Black &amp; White.</p>

<p>Shaymin Sky Forme requires the Gracidea, which can only be acquired from
Platinum onward by presenting a fateful encounter Shaymin. Shaymin acquired at
the Flower Paradise in Platinum counts as fateful encounter, but not Diamond
or Pearl. The Gracidea is a Key Item and cannot be traded.</p>

<p>Spiky-eared Pichu is unlocked in HeartGold and SoulSilver by the presence
of an event shiny Pichu. It cannot be traded, but the shiny Pichu can.</p>
