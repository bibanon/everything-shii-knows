<p>Dear diary</p>

<p>As I sit on my toilet reading the e-mails in my archive from mid 1999
on my waterproof touch screen that doubles as a mirror, I laugh to
myself about the confusion that people had back then about digital
convergence.
When I look around me now , its hard to see why. (The benefit of hindsight)</p>

<p>For a start, I never have to worry about running out of toilet roll now that
the toilet
monitors its use and notifies my fridge when stocks are low, so that when
the fridge orders
my shopping, toilet roll is top of the list.</p>

<p>Take yesterday for example, a valve in my house's water tank began to wear
out and
notified Tescos (My water supplier). They dispatched a nanodroid through the
water pipe
which rebuilt the valve last night. I remember the days when water leaks
caused a fair
amount of damage when they failed. Thank god these days are gone.
I mean, what would have happened to my solar panels if water had accumulated
behind
them?</p>

<p>I'm listening to the Rolling Stones new album which my stereo downloaded 3
days ago.
You really can't tell the difference between the real Stones I remember as a
child and their
holographic reproduction. Some argue they sound better now.</p>

<p>Its good that my TV set notified me that they were repeating Red Dwarf
series 2 on
BBC234 last night and recorded it for me. I still haven't updated my 20th
century
collection of DVD (Heh, remember that!) and would have hated missing it.
Especially now
that they are making the follow-up to the first film finally.</p>

<p>Bloody Amiga, they took over the world. Amiga this, Amiga that. God knows we
could
have done without that Emperor Collas deciding that we needed everything
"converged".
I can't be the only one that remembers not having to ask your coffee machine
to give you a
stronger cup. Who cares if its bad for you.</p>

<p>Sometimes I miss the days when I would sit in front of my Amiga 4000.
telling it what to
do. OK, so it would take nearly 30seconds to boot and you had to load the
software to use
it, but there was something nice about having to type into a keyboard or
waggle a joystick
whilst looking at a 21" light projector when pretending to fly a plane.</p>

<p>Bloody iris projectors. Bloody brain implants.</p>

<p>Its not the same now that I can sit inside the Sopwith Camel flying over
France with
complete accuracy , strafing rabbits (Beautifully rendered in Lightwave 67)
and smelling
the corordite as the surround sound warns me of the Red Baron approaching
from the sun.
Its too real now. It takes the fun out of it if you ask me.</p>

<p>The kids nowadays don't understand.
"If you don't feel the punch from  your opponent, it isn't real" they say.
Of course you
don't actually get hurt, but the sensation is reproduced so that you know
you have been
hit.
I much preferred the screen flashing red but of course, I'm an old fart now
so what do I
know..</p>

<p>The.e is .omthing wr.ng wi.h my wat.h it. no. pickin. my .oice up co.rect.y
That's better. I don't suppose I can complain about the modern world really.
That
recalibration built into all the electronics works wonders.</p>

<p>My coffee cup has just informed me I am stressed, its booking me on a flight
to Goose
Green in the Falklands. That's what I need, a nice tropical holiday. I must
get out of
Scotland once in a while. The sun is too strong these days. Only five
minutes outside
without a radiation suite. It plays havoc with the skin. Its just as well my
shower releases
moisturiser when it detects my skin is damaged or I would look like my age.</p>

<p>Oh hang on, The stereo is just telling me its found some music that fits my
listening
requirements.. Downloading now..</p>

<p>Its Man, another 1970's band.. Am I really that old?</p>

<p>Oh the lights have come on, it must be getting late. I'm just going out the
back to see the
sunset while its safe.  I wish they hadn't painted in red and white
though....</p>
