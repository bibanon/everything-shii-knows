<h1>Which Team Fortress 2 map is which?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>This map identification guide should help you to describe a Team
Fortress map quickly and accurately to someone who has played on that
map but cannot remember the name.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>2Fort</dt>
	<dd>A capture the flag map. Each team has a building with two front
	doors, separated by a water moat with a rooved bridge across it.
	There are sniper battlements above the front doors and both a regular
	staircase and spiral staircase inside the base.</dd>

	<dt>Badlands</dt>
	<dd>A desert arena and capture point map. The middle point is
	on a wooden bridge and the second points are on top of a spiral.</dd>

	<dt>Badwater Basin</dt>
	<dd>A single-stage payload map. The cart heads left and through a
	tunnel at the beginning.</dd>

	<dt>Double Cross</dt>
	<dd>An industrial capture the flag only map. There is a bridge in
	the centre of the map, with a pile of boxes and sand on it at
	its midpoint.</dd>

	<dt>Dustbowl</dt>
	<dd>A three-stage desert attack/defend map. Stage 1 is where
	Blue starts by capturing A in a hut on the left with a canyon to
	the right. Stage 2 is where he leaves spawn, goes into a trench
	and comes back out again, with point A ahead and to the left,
	and point B to the right and through mines. Stage 3 is where
	they begin in an underground grey building and point A is
	behind a building on the left, and follow a snaking path to
	point B which is across a	grey bridge.</dd>

	<dt>Egypt</dt>
	<dd>The one with the hieroglyphs.</dd>

	<dt>Fastlane</dt>
	<dd>A capture point map with many wooden buildings. The centre
	point is sparsely protected by wood panels and the last point is
	in a large dark room with a wire mesh walkway above it.</dd>

	<dt>Gold Rush</dt>
	<dd>A three-stage desert payload map. If it's not the one where
	you push through a long tunnel at the start, it's probably a
	stage of Gold Rush.</dd>

	<dt>Gorge</dt>
	<dd>An alpine/industrial attack-defend map. Capture point A is
	on a concrete bridge, and capture point B is indoors in a pit.</dd>

	<dt>Granary</dt>
	<dd>An industrial arena and capture point map. The centre point
	is surrounded by red and blue shipping crates.</dd>

	<dt>Gravel Pit</dt>
	<dd>A capture point map. Blue must capture both A and B before
	capturing C in a rickety tower outside Red spawn. Red usually loses
	at least either A or B.</dd>

	<dt>Harvest</dt>
	<dd>A king of the hill map set on an abandoned farm.</dd>

	<dt>Hoodoo</dt>
	<dd>A three stage desert payload map. Blue starts by pushing the cart
	up a narrow hill and then to the left.</dd>

	<dt>Hydro</dt>
	<dd>The only territorial control type map. You capture one enemy
	point while guarding your own. Multiple stages.</dd>

	<dt>Junction.</dt>
	<dd>A dark indoors attack/defend map. There are three control points.</dd>

	<dt>Lumberyard</dt>
	<dd>An alpine arena-only map. The capture point is indoors and
	the only health box is balanced on a log over a cliff edge.</dd>

	<dt>Nucleus</dt>
	<dd>A high-tech looking arena and king of the hill map. The
	centre point is in the middle on a platform underneath a high-tech
	glowing device, and is only accessible by four catwalks.</dd>

	<dt>Offblast</dt>
	<dd>A desert arena-only map. The centre point is underneath a missile
	and the outside is a path cut around a mountainside.</dd>

	<dd>A desert arena only map. (I haven't actually played this map.)</dd>

	<dt>Sawmill</dt>
	<dd>A capture the flag, arena and king of the hill map. The
	centre point has saws around it and a log hanging above it.</dd>

	<dt>Steel</dt>
	<dd>A five-point attack-defend map. Blue must only capture E to win.
	Blue can only capture A to D in order to make it easier to capture E.
	E is a circular platform over a pit which scouts can jump to before
	the bridge is unlocked by a capture.</dd>

	<dt>Turbine</dt>
	<dd>An indoor capture the flag map. The map has a system of vents
	and the spawn room has transparent walls facing the corridor.</dd>

	<dt>Viaduct</dt>
	<dd>A king of the hill map. It has a snowy central point.</dd>

	<dt>Watchtower</dt>
	<dd>An alpine arena map. The centre point is in a wooden shack
	reachable by pipes. From spawn, players can run ahead along the pipe
	or around to the left and right.</dd>

	<dt>Well</dt>
	<dd>An industrial arena, capture the flag, and capture point map.
	The centre point is in a building which trains run through.</dd>

	<dt>Yukon</dt>
