<h1>Sneech spoilers</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>The more time you spend with
<a href="http://www.shoecakegames.com/sneech/">Sneech</a> (an arena
multiplayer Worm/Snake game for the Amiga), the more you get the
impression that each CPU opponent has a distinct personality. Not bad
considering that the characters are just different colours of dot
snake!</p>

<p>Now that the game's author has released
<a href="http://sneech.net/files/sneechpro.txt">the source code to Sneech</a>,
we can finally see what makes them tick.</p>

<p>Warning: Reading the following list might spoil the magic for you.
If you don't want to see the Sneech characters reduced to cold facts
and figures, quit this page now. Go read
<a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/k240">my K240 page</a> or
read up on the <a href="http://sneech.net/">Sneech port for iPhone</a>
instead. If you still want to know why Mr.White is so speedy,
read on.</p>

<h2>Statistics meanings</h2>

<p>Favoured items are applied as follows. The AI receives one of the
first item on its list for free unless it's already at maximum. It
buys one of the second item if it can afford it and is not at maximum,
then one of the third item if it can afford it and is not at maximum.</p>

<p>The AI then enters a loop to buy other items. It picks an item at
random, which can be any except Stun and Shop Page 3 (Shield 25%,
Shield 50%, Auto Turn, Bomb Grab and Shield Grab). If it can afford
this and is not carrying the maximum of that item, there is a random
chance which varies by item that it will buy it:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>100%:</b> Super Scooper, Pass Through, Constant Speed,
		Slow Scooper, Speed Booster, Extra Size, (Auto Turn) </li>
	<li><b>50%:</b> (Stunner), Self Reverse, Bomb Deflect</li>
	<li><b>33%:</b> Extra Speed, Reverse, Bomb</li>
	<li><b>25%:</b> Survive as 1</li>
	<li><b>20%:</b> Random Factor, Extra Life</li>
	<li><b>16.67%:</b> No Dead Money, (Shield 50%)</li>
	<li><b>9.09%:</b> (Shield 25%, Stun Grab)</li>
	<li><b>6.25%:</b> (Bomb Grab)</li>
</ul>

<p>The AI repeats this shopping loop for a maximum of 150
milliseconds. It has a one in 26 chance each time to break
out of the shopping loop, unless this is the final round
and the AI still has 80 or more money to spend.</p>

<p>Ahead and Speed are attributes used in the AI routines. Unfortunately
I haven't worked out exactly what they do yet. Higher-ranked opponents
tend to have a higher Ahead.</p>
