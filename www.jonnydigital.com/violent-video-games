<h1>Why video games are not going to kill your children</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>I'm sick of hearing complaints from parents who have been somehow
duped into thinking violent video games are going lead their children
on a crime spree. If you're a parent, I encourage you to read this
and pass it on: your children are safer than you think.</p>

<p>Let me present a few facts. You don't have to trust me here - you can
do your own research and confirm these for yourself.</p>

<h2>Videogames already have an established age-rating system</h2>

<p>Just like movies, video games have had their own age rating
system for years now. The Entertainment Software Rating Board
or ESRB was founded in 1994, the same time that violent video
games began to appear. In Europe, the PEGI age rating system
has been used since 2003, which replaced the UK's ELSPA age
rating system founded in 1994.</p>

<p>Parents are sometimes fooled into buying age-inappropriate
titles by their children, who exploit the parent's lack of
familiarity with the video games rating system. You wouldn't
take a child to a "17+" rated movie, so why would you buy them
a 17+ rated game?</p>

<p>Age ratings are often enforced by store policy, and in some
places, enforced by law. The ESRB's system is considered by many
to be one of the most detailed and accurate rating systems
available. It's a largely trustworthy system, with most of
the controversy involving kids playing games that they shouldn't
according to the ESRB rating.</p>

<h2>Controversial news stories sell</h2>

<p>You'll never read "Video games are safe" as a newspaper
headline, because it's not news. It's not interesting, at least
not to most parents who don't play videogames. On the other hand,
"Something is going to kill your children" is big news, even
if the journalist had to bend a few truths to fit it onto the
television.</p>

<h2>Puberty makes your kids violent anyway</h2>

<p>It's easy to forget how disobedient and rebellious we were
as teenagers. Teachers, parents and child psychologists agree
that it's not unusual for children entering puberty to become
moody, disobedient and even violent - it's a phase we all go
through as human beings.</p>

<p>Teenagers also become rebellious and moody in families which
don't own any video games. It's easy to blame this new technology
of video games, but the much simpler explanation is that your kids
are just growing up.</p>

<h2>Parents don't know their video games</h2>

<p>You're out of touch with your kids when it comes to music, fashion
and pop culture. It happens. So why do we expect video games
to be any different?</p>

<h2>Violent games are for grown-ups</h2>

<p>Computer technology has improved drastically since 1985,
when video games were too primitive and cartoony to appeal to
older players. Today, the average gamer is in his mid-twenties to thirties,
and it's at this demographic that violent games are targeted.</p>

<h2>Mothers worry too much</h2>

<p>You know this yourself, if you're a mother. How often have you
been concerned about something happening your child, only to find out
later that there was nothing to worry about? It's only natural to
want to protect your children, but that instinct can push people to
over-react to "stay on the safe side".</p>

<h2>You can protect your children</h2>

<p>Finally, it doesn't take laws or game prohibition to keep your
kids safe. You just need to take care that you don't give your
kid games with age-inappropriate content. The age rating is a
good guideline, but ultimately as a parent it's up to you
what you let your kids play.</p>
