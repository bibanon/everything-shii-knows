<p>Ragadorn Ale-House Brawl
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29346/ragadorn-alehouse-brawl">
is a board game</a> featured in
<a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/TheMagnamundCompanion">The Magnamund Companion</a>,
a setting guide for the world of the
<a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Home">Lone Wolf gamebooks</a>.
It's quite fun, but it's from an era of ambiguous or badly-written rules,
where players were assumed to be familiar with miniatures games or were
expected to work rules on their own.</p>

<p>Here are some of the rules clarifications and variants I've used
in play. The original rules can be found on pages 46-51 and 97 of
<a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/TheMagnamundCompanion">The Magnamund Companion</a>,
available for download in PDF at Project Aon.</p>

<h2>Board game equipment</h2>

<p>I use ten sided dice rather than the random number chart.
A roll of 10 counts as zero.</p>

<p>You should create tokens for each character's mundane weapon.
These come in handy when someone throws a weapon, as happens
when they have a magic weapon or have looted a spare weapon
for throwing.</p>

<h2>Order of play</h2>

<p>Clarification: Each player moves all of his characters before the
next player moves all of his. Play goes clockwise for the first round,
then anticlockwise for the second round, and so on.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p><b>What happens if you must place your character at a door, but
all five door squares are taken?</b></p>

<p>Strictly speaking, if you roll a 7, 8 or 9 when placing your character
at the beginning, they must be placed on a door square. If they can't,
it seems your character is outside of the tavern and must wait until
round 2 to enter. You might relax this and allow the character to be placed
adjacent to a door square.

<h2>Movement Quarter</h2>

<p><b>How does the "Talk" option work?</b></p>

<p>The "Talk" option isn't elaborated on. I decided that a player
who elects to talk may trade gold and items. They may trade secret
messages, although I've yet to play a game where anyone wished to do
this. The Knight may use Talk to tell the Adventuress she is under arrest,
and may attack her if she moves away, throws at the Knight, or starts
combat with the Knight. Trading occurs immediately, since there's
no reason not to.</p>

<p><b>Where can you pick up items from?</b></p>

<p>The rules are unclear. The Missile Phase only allows you to throw
adjacent items, not items you're standing on. However, I've house
ruled that on the movement phase you can pick up items from any adjacent
square or your own square. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to
loot a body you're standing on.</p>

<p>The rule is that looting a body in the movement phase takes one point
of movement per item. I've decided that any amount of gold counts as
a single item. You can't loot diagonally, since that's two squares away.</p>

<p><b>Can you pick up bar items like chairs?</b></p>

<p>I've house ruled this to say no. There's no sensible way to carry
multiple chairs, even if the rules allow it. The early rounds of
the game would see players hoard all the throwable items for later.</p>

<h2>Missile Quarter</h2>

<p><b>What happens if a missile misses, but there's no room for it
to land?</b></p>

<p>If a missile misses its target and the roll is odd, it lands behind
its target. The rules don't specify what happens if the opponent has
his back to the wall. You might place it beside the character, or on the
character, or have the item break.</p>

<p><b>What happens to missiles that hit?</b></p>

<p>The rules don't specify what happens to missiles after they hit
their target. I've ruled that weapons land on the square of the
character they hit, but bar items such as chairs are destroyed. The
axe counts as a weapon.</p>

<p><b>Do magic weapons still have to roll on the missile chart?</b></p>

<p>Yes. As per the rules, thrown magical weapons deal extra damage
only if a successful hit is scored. Magical weapons are Lone Wolf's
Magic Spear, the Magic Sword (Special Item) and Magic Mace (Special Item),
as listed in rules on what magical weapons can harm the Helghast.</p>

<h2>Combat Quarter</h2>

<p><b>Can multiple attackers fight the same target?</b></p>

<p>The rules don't say you can't, so it seems logical that you can.
It's not an unreasonable house rule to allow only one character to fight
at a time.</p>

<p>There's a confusing rule that characters can only co-operate
with other player's characters once they have talked to each other.
Does this mean multi-way combat is possible, but only between your
own characters? Was this rule written assuming one player per
character as in 7-10 player mode, suggesting that your own characters
can't team up without talking first?</p>

<p>The only side-effect of multiple-attacker combat is that it's
possible to flee from one opponent even though combat continues with
the other.</p>

<p><b>Who is the "loser" of the combat?</b></p>

<p>The rules specify that the loser chooses whether to continue the
combat or flee, but doesn't specify who the loser is. We decided
it to mean the character who loses the most hit points. If both
characters lose the same amount, neither is the loser, and combat
automatically continues.</p>

<p><b>In what order is fleeing resolved?</b></p>

<p>By the rules, a fleeing character must move before the character
who he is fleeing from. We ruled that fleeing characters move
before any other characters in the movement round.</p>

<p><b>Does looting a body take any movement points?</b></p>

<p>If you kill an opponent, you can loot any or all of his equipment
immediately at no cost. Since it's not the movement round, there
can't be any movement cost.</p>

<p><b>Do multiple magic weapons stack?</b></p>

<p>I still haven't decided this. The rules don't specify that you
can't gain both bonuses. On the other hand, it's illogical for a
character to wield both the Magic Sword and the Magic Mace in order
to gain a total of +6 to Combat Skill. Nothing in the Lone Wolf
setting suggests that merely carrying a second magic weapon imparts
any combat benefit.</p>

<h2>Gaming Quarter</h2>

<p><b>Can you gamble while fleeing?</b></p>

<p>You can gamble when not involved in combat, so the question is
whether or not a character who has opted to flee is still in combat.
I would suggest that a fleeing character is too busy running to
gamble.</p>

<p><b>If I bet on 9 and the table rolls a 0, do I receive twice
my stake?</b></p>

<p>Yes, or there would be no reason to bet on 0 or 9.</p>

<p><b>Can the table run out of money?</b></p>

<p>There are no rules which say so. The Gaming Table can be considered
a limitless supply of money. However, the Landlord's goal is to make
a profit of 40 Gold Crowns at the end of the night.</p>

<p><b>Can gambling occur when there are bodies or objects on the
Gaming Table?</b></p>

<p>Gambling cannot occur if player's character is standing on the
Gaming Table. The rules say nothing about bodies or objects, so you
can.</p>

<h2>Special Items</h2>

<p><b>When can the Elixir of Life and Laumspur be used?</b></p>

<p>There are no particular rules, but I play assuming you can
use the healing potions at any time, except when you are reduced
to 0 Endurance.</p>

<p><b>When can Alether be used?</b></p>

<p>I usually decide that it can be used just before combat. The
attacker should always ask the defender his Combat Skill, in case
it has changed. At this point, if either player wishes to use his
Alether, he may.</p>

<p><b>When can the Magic Wand be used, and what is its effect?</b></p>

<p>The rules only say that it stops any character from moving for
two turns. I interpret this that it causes the player to have no
movement points on his next two Movement Quarters. The wand can
be used at any time, as the rules don't say it must be used in any
particular quarter. It has no range limit.</p>

<p><b>When can the Spell Book be used, and what is its effect?</b></p>

<p>The rules only say that it puts a character to sleep for two turns.
I interpret this as causing him to miss his entire next two turns. The
book can be used at any time and has no range limit.</p>

<p>As a sleeping character should be extremely vulnerable to attack
and shouldn't be able to use his Combat Skill, I added a house rule that
sleeping characters cannot be fought in combat. This prevents the Spell
Book from being used for an easy kill on a defenceless target. They can
be looted as a body, however.</p>

<h2>Score</h2>

<p><b>Can dead characters achieve objectives?</b></p>

<p>This is a tricky point, and can be argued either way. I suggest
that a dead character can't earn points for achieving his objective.</p>

<p>In tactical terms, you can kill a character who has already
achieved his objective, in order to stop a player who has taken the
lead. This gives players an interesting choice between defending the
characters who have achieved their objective already, and helping the
characters who haven't.</p>

<p>It doesn't make sense for most of the characters to consider
themselves victorious if they are killed after achieving their
objective. Some explicitly need to attain their objective in order
to escape unharmed. The only characters selfless enough to
sacrifice themself in their objective are Lone Wolf and the
Helghast, and they have higher aims than to get killed in a
bar fight.</p>

<p><b>Can characters achieve each other's objectives?</b></p>

<p>If someone kills your target for you, I generally rule that this is
equivalent to you having killed them, assuming you're still alive to
witness it. The alternative would be that you can deny an objective by
killing someone else's target mid-combat with a thrown bottle.</p>

<p><b>Can dead characters get points for holding Special Items?</b></p>

<p>Although the rules aren't specific on this point, I rule that
they don't. A player gives his character card away when killed, so
even if the items aren't taken, the player doesn't have the card
at the end of the round to add up the points. Only characters
can own magic items, not bodies.</p>

<p><b>Do expended items count toward score?</b></p>

<p>The Alether and Laumspur are specifically removed from play
when used. Technically, the rules don't say the Elixir of Life,
Spell Book or Magic Wand are discarded when used up, but it's
reasonable to play as such. The Spell Book or Magic Wand still
count toward score as long as they have one use left.</p>

<p><b>Do the Alether and Laumspur count as Special Items for the
purpose of score?</b></p>

<p>The rules refer to Alether and Laumspur as Special Items, although
they're picked up as loot tokens rather than given out at the start, and
the Lone Wolf book series doesn't refer to them as Special Items.
Rules-as-written, however, they are Special Items, and count toward
score.</p>

<h2>Objectives and the Helghast</h2>

<p><b>What happens if my target is revealed to be the Helghast?</b></p>

<p>The most sensible approach is that your character must kill the
Helghast or at least see it dead. This way, the character still has a
chance of achieving his objective, rather than automatically succeding
or failing.</p>

<p>If the Magician or Ranger is the Helghast, the Mercenary must
still kill him, as the Helghast could have been the traitor. If the
Herbwarden is the Helghast, the Druid must still kill him, as he is
a spy for the Darklords. If the Adventuress is the Helghast, then the
Helghast killed the Knight's brother, and he must kill it. If the
Merchant is the Helghast, the Ranger is stubborn enough that he must
still get his 15 Gold Crowns.</p>

<p><b>How does the Knight arrest the Adventuress?</b></p>

<p>The Knight my only attack the Adventuress "if she offers resistance".
In play we decided that the Knight may not attack or throw objects
at the Adventuress without first talking. If she moves away from the
Knight, attacks him or throws an object at him, the Knight may thereafter
attack and kill her normally to acheive his objective. The Adventuress
may give herself up, although she will fail in her objective.</p>

<p>If the Adventuress is the Helghast, the Knight does not have to
attempt to arrest it.</p>

<p><b>How can the Adventuress acquire the large diamond if someone
spends it at the Gaming Table?</b></p>

<p>The diamond can't be spent at the table. It's worth 30 Gold Crowns,
and the maximum stake is 10.</p>

<p><b>How can the Ranger achieve his objective without killing
the Merchant?</b></p>

<p>He can trade with the Merchant by talking, or loot it from the
Merchant's body if nobody else has taken it. The Ranger must take
the Merchant's gold from him, as a matter of principle. He can't
take it from someone else who took it from the Merchant, or win it
from the Merchant when gambling.</p>

<p><b>How much gold must the Merchant and Landlord have to win?</b></p>

<p>The Merchant must acquire 50 gold on top of the 20 he already
owns, so 70.</p>

<p>The Landlord must end the night with an overall profit of at least 40
gold at the gaming table.</p>
