<h1>Home power generation in Northern Ireland</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>I decided to investigate the cost-effectiveness of generating
your own power from renewable source (wind and solar) in Northern
Ireland.</p>

<h2>The basics</h2>

<p>A power generator's output is measured in kilowatts (kW), or
units of 1,000 watts. One unit of electricity is equivalent to
one <em>kilowatt-hour</em> (kWh), or the amount of energy produced
by a one-kilowatt generator in one hour. Northern Ireland's
electricity supplier, NIE Energy, currently charges 15.03p per
unit.</p>

<p>You can, however, generate your own electricity and any surplus
back to the grid. With renewable sources (wind/solar), your running
costs are almost zero (assuming nothing breaks down), so the only
issue is whether or not you will recoup your initial cost, and
how soon.</p>

<h2>NIE Energy Generation Tariff</h2>

<p>NIE currently offers <a href="http://www.nie-yourenergy.co.uk/micro4a.php#micro">5.22p</a>
per unit generated.</p>

<p>In addition, generating electricity from
renewable sources entitles you to Renewable Obligation Certificates
from electricity regulator OFGEM, which NIE will currently buy from
you for <a href="http://www.nie-yourenergy.co.uk/micro5a.php#micro">8.32p</a>
per unit generated. You receive these <em>whether you use the generated
electricity yourself or sell it</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, each unit you sell currently pays 13.54p, while each
unit you use yourself saves 15.03p and earns 8.32p for a total of
23.35p.</p>

<h2>Solar cost-effectiveness</h2>

<p>The European Commission Joint Research Centre estimates that
Northern Ireland receives sufficient sunlight for a 1kW solar
panel to generate between 700 and 1,000 kilowatt-hours per year,
depending on location and optimal positioning (see
<a href="http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/cmaps/eu_opt/pvgis_solar_optimum_GB.png">optimum positioning chart</a>,
<a href="http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/cmaps/eu_hor/pvgis_solar_horiz_GB.png">sub-optimal positoning chart</a>).
An <a href="http://www.nie-yourenergy.co.uk/casestudies/carrickfergus.pdf">NIE case study</a> (PDF) in
Carrickfergus estimates 900 kilowatt-hours.</p>

<p>For each 1kW of solar panel installed, you will receive around
&pound;94.78 to &pound;135.40 per year if all power is sold, and earn/save
&pound;163.45 to &pound;233.50 per year if all power is used. Since you'll
probably use some and sell some, the result will probably be
somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>The initial cost will be several thousand pounds, a significant
amount of which can be covered by a renewable energy grant.
A search of <a href="http://www.lowcarbonbuildings.org.uk/info/installers/find/installerfind">accredited
solar panel installers</a> suggests total costs of around &pound;5,000
to 7,000 per kilowatt (peak) depending on size.
<a href="http://www.nie-yourenergy.co.uk/renewablegrants.php#householderlcbp">Grants available</a> from
NIE and the Low Carbon Buildings Programme can reduce this to
something in the region of &pound;3,000-&pound;3,600 for a 1kW installation,
or &pound;5,700-&pound;9,700 for a 2kW installation.</p>

<p>The big question is how soon the system will become
cost-effective. A 1kW installation will generate 700 to
1,000 units per year, earning/saving &pound;163.45 to &pound;233.50
per year assuming you use all the energy, and 20% less
if you sell half. Given current rates and reasonable
installation costs of &pound;3,500, it will take at least
fifteen years just to break even on a 1kW installation at
current rates, and potentially longer than 20 years.</p>

<p>Increasing the initial investment doesn't provide
much help, since energy sent back to the grid is less
valuable than energy saved and the grant on initial costs
is capped.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b> Solar power in Northern Ireland isn't
cost-effective yet. We have poor solar coverage, initial costs
are too high to be cost-effective compared to paying for
electricity, and NIE doesn't pay enough for green energy
for this to be worth it.</p>

<h2>Wind cost-effectiveness</h2>

<p>Northern Ireland has some of the best wind speeds in
Europe, ranging from 5m/s to 11m/s at a height of 50m,
or about 4.4m/s to 9m/s at a height of 10m. This is about
on par with Texas which currently generates around 8,000MW
from wind power, although admittedly using taller, larger
wind towers than you can reasonably site in your back garden.
(Source: <a href="http://www.windatlas.dk/Europe/landmap.html">European Wind Atlas</a>,
<a href="http://www.mrsolar.com/faq/faq17.php">United States annual average wind power</a>)</p>

<p>Just how much electricity this converts to and what
this will cost to install depends on the model of wind
turbine used. Straight comparison is difficult since
different manufacturers rate their products assuming
different wind speeds and many are not up-front about
total installed cost. Some rate their device assuming
wind speeds much higher than the UK average.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ardenhamenergy.co.uk/domestic_pricelist.php">One retailer</a>
offers a 2.5kW wind installation which in Northern
Ireland would cost &pound;12,500 installed 
<a href="http://www.nie-yourenergy.co.uk/renewablegrants.php#householderlcbp">after grants</a>
from NIE and the Low Carbon Buildings Programme.
At wind speeds of 5m/s (UK average), the manufacturer
estimates 3,500 units of electricity per year, which
assuming you use half and sell half back to the grid
will net &pound;645.56 per year, breaking even in 19 years.
A 6kW installation, assuming you can use half of the
estimated 9,500 units generated, will cost &pound;18,500
after rebate, earn &pound;1752.275/year, and break even
in 10 and a half years.</p>

<p>Things look significantly better if you get high wind,
such as a hilly area. A 50% increase in wind speed in will
more than double the energy available to the windmill, since
the wattage produced is equal to the wind speed times the
windmill's blade length squared. An average speed of 7m/s
will produce twice as much, so the 2.5kW wind turbine
above will pay for itself in 10 years and the 6kW installation
in 5 years. Parts of Northern Ireland receiving an average
of 9m/s or higher will find it increasingly cost-effective
to employ wind turbines at these rates.</p>

<p>Prices currently vary significantly, with <a href="http://www.wind-rotor.com/files/ServicePages-Download-36.pdf">one UK supplier</a> (PDF)
offering a 6kW installation for around &pound;30,000 installed
(&pound;5,000/kW) after Northern Ireland rebate, while another
offers <a href="http://www.windpoweruk.com/5kw_wind_turbine_kit.htm">a 5kW DIY kit</a>
for under &pound;2,800 after rebate (&pound;560/kW), without installation.
The options mentioned earlier works out to &pound;3,083 (6kW) and
&pound;5,000 (2.5kW) per kilowatt.</p>

<p>Other than price, the major drawbacks to a windmill are
that it's pretty big (5.5m to 11m masts are typical),
you'll need to apply for planning permission, and the
neighbours might complain. Smaller roof-mounted models
are available, although their performance is lower.
<a href="http://www.renewabledevices.com/images/est%20location%20location%20location%20july%202009.pdf">In one test</a> (PDF),
a 1.5kW <a href="http://www.renewabledevices.com/swift/specification.htm">SWIFT Turbine</a>
(&pound;3,000 after Northern Ireland rebate, price not including installation)
generated 975kWh in Scotland, which has similar or better
wind speeds to Northern Ireland. This would earn around
&pound;179.84 per year and break even in 17 years.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b> Wind power has good potential in
Northern Ireland, but is most effective in rural areas
where wind speeds are high. Build-up areas have poorer
wind speed and fewer opportunities for positioning good
tall windmills, 

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Northern Ireland has good wind potential, but rubbish solar.
It's not even worth considering solar power until solar panel
prices come down, normal electricity prices go way up, NIE
starts paying a lot more for green energy, or government
subsidies for renewable energy are drastically increased.
The best-case payoff for solar is over 10 years.</p>

<p>Wind power can be quite effective in rural hilly areas, but
less so in urban ones where wind speeds are lower. Building
an 11 metre windmill mast in your back yard is a difficult
proposition, and even the best roof-mounted small windmills
don't break even for over 15 years.</p>
