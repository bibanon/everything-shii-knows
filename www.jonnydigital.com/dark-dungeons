<h1>Dark Dungeons: Jack Chick's misleading propaganda</h1>
<p class="subtitle">From <a href="http://www.jonnydigital.com/">Jonathan's Reference Pages</a></p>
<hr><!-- ======================================================== -->

<p>In 1984, Christian comic author Jack Chick published
<a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0046/0046_01.asp">Dark Dungeons</a>,
a short tale of a girl who commits suicide when her character is
killed in a fantasy roleplaying game. It's presented as a warning
to parents, but unfortunately it's horribly misleading.</p>

<h2>1: That's not how the game works</h2>

<p>In the Dark Dungeons comic, we see an adult Dungeon Master who
tells the players what to do. If this was the extent of Dungeons &amp;
Dragons, it would get old fast. The Dungeon Master controls only
the dungeon and its contents of treasure and monsters - hence the
title.</p>

<p>Players also aren't kicked out of the group when their characters
are killed. In older editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, this could
occur rather frequently, and players would simply create a new
character. I also had trouble finding any rule in the <cite>Dungeon
Master's Guide</cite> that covered inducting players into a witches'
coven.</p>

<p>If Jack Chick did his research correctly, he covered it up
to make his point.</p>

<h2>2: Marcie's friends are poor friends</h2>

<p>If there's a Christian moral to be drawn from this story, it's
about the value of friendship. Marcie's friends reject her when
her character is killed, and she experiences despair as a result.
Debbie blames the game when her friend commits suicide, but it's
Debbie who failed her friend when she was needed most.</p>

<p>Compassion is an important Christian value. Both Debbie and
the Dungeon Master fail to show any sort of compassion for Marcie,
even when she calls on the phone and "sounds really upset".</p>

<h2>3: Magic doesn't exist</h2>

<p>The most ridiculous event of the Dark Dungeons story is when
the Dungeon Master teaches Debbie to use real magic. While modern-day
neopagan organizations and practices certainly exist, the idea that
these rituals hold real power is laughable.</p>

<h2>4: Most players aren't witches</h2>

<p>Jack Chick appears to assert that it's commonplace for D&amp;D
players to become witches, but there's no evidence to suggest this.
Fantasy roleplaying is called 'fantasy' for a reason, and there's
a big difference between telling a story and believing that you
possess real magic.</p>

<p>Even modern practitioners of witchcraft are aware of this
distinction. While witchcraft is prohibited according to
Deuteronomy 18, games of fantasy are not, unless the player
is unable to distinguish game from reality, such that they
interfere with the player's morality.</p>

<h2>5: The comic ignores Christian game aspects</h2>

<p>When played among Christians, Dungeons &amp; Dragons can
serve as a useful tool for learning positive morals. The
idea of heroes working together to fight against evil creatures
can serve as an allegory for everyday people who fight against
spiritual evil.</p>

<p>The game allows free will, meaning that player characters
can do good things or evil as they choose, and yet players
tend strongly to pick good over evil. Even when the characters
become strong enough to conquer the game's entire world by
force, players usually do the right thing and play heroes
instead of villains.</p>

<p>It's also on record that Dungeons &amp; Dragons creator Gary
Gygax became a Christian while playing his own game.</p>
