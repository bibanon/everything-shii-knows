This may seem to go without saying, but in fact my work has been criticized for characterizing 2012 as a 'cosmogenesis.' Here the scholars are one step closer to understanding 2012 for what the Maya knew it to a be: <i>a rebirth and the beginning of a new World Age.</i>"<br /><small>Source: John Major Jenkins. <a href="http://alignment2012.com/bolon-yokte.html" class="external free" title="http://alignment2012.com/bolon-yokte.html" rel="nofollow">http://alignment2012.com/bolon-yokte.html</a></small>&lt;/p&gt;

These valleys of the earth shall come to an end. For those katuns there shall be no priests, and no one who believes in his government without having doubts...Pay heed to the truth which I present to you in the katun of dishonor.

The face of the sun shalll be extinguished because of the great tempest. Then finally the ornaments shall descend in heaps. there will be good gifts for one and all, as well as lands, from the Great Spirit, wherever they shall settle down. Presently Baktun 13 shall come sailing, figuratively speaking, bringing the ornaments of which I have spoken from your ancestors. Then the god will come to visit his little ones.

<p>"There was, however, nothing arbitrary about the fixing of the end of the Long Count era. Victoria Bricker has pointed out to me that 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ahau 3 Kankin corresponds to an astronomically correct winter solstice: December 21, 2012 A.D. (Julian day number 2456283). Thus there appears to be a strong likelihood that the eral calendar, like the year calendar, was motivated by a long-range astronomical prediction, one that made a correct solsticial forecast 2,367 years into the future in 355 B.C."

</p>
<a name="Xibalba_and_World_Tree" id="Xibalba_and_World_Tree"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Xibalba and World Tree</span></h3>
<p>"At sundown Xibalba [the underworld] rotated above the Earth to become the night sky." (Forest of Kings p. 66) Specifically, the black band in the Milky Way-- the galactic equator. (Popul Vuh)
</p><p>"This [World] Tree was the conduit of communication between the supernatural world and the human world: The souls of the dead fell into Xibalba along its path; the daily journeys of the sun, moon, planets and stars followed its trunk. (ibid. p.90)
</p><p>"Linda Schele provided a clue in the recent book <i>Maya Cosmos</i>. Probably the most exciting breakthrough in this book is her identification of the astronomical meaning of the Mayan Sacred Tree. Drawing from an impressive amount of iconographic evidence, and generously sharing the process by which she arrived at her discovery, the Sacred Tree is found to be none other than the crossing point of the ecliptic with the band of the Milky Way. Indeed, the Milky Way seems to have played an important role in Mayan imagery. For example, an incised bone from 8th century Tikal depicts a long sinking canoe containing various deities. This is a picture of the night sky and the canoe is the Milky Way, sinking below the horizon as the night progresses, and carrying with it deities representing the nearby constellations. The incredible Mayan site of Palenque is filled with Sacred Tree motifs and references to astronomical events. " <a href="http://alignment2012.com/why2012.html" class="external text" title="http://alignment2012.com/why2012.html" rel="nofollow">JMJ</a>
</p>
<a name="Galactic_Alignment" id="Galactic_Alignment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Galactic Alignment</span></h3>
<p>JMJ Galactic Alignment theory is that 12/21/2012 is purposefully the Sun's conjunction with Xibalba. The Maya probably knew about the procession of the equinoxes, but did they devise their calendar to include it? We don't have any hard evidence for that. JMJ includes a lot of <i>drawings</i> and interpretations thereof to support his theory. Two big blows to this theory:
</p>
<ol><li> The Maya were way more concerned with everyday lives of their kings than planning for a date 1500 years in the future.
</li><li> There is no evidence from inscriptions that the Maya cared about equinoxes at all.
</li></ol>
<a name="Identify_of_Bolon_Yokte.27_Kuh" id="Identify_of_Bolon_Yokte.27_Kuh"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Identify of Bolon Yokte' Kuh</span></h2>
<p>JMJ theory on Bolon Yokte' K'uh is that it's a pun on <i>balan</i>, "jaguar", explaining that jaguar foot that often appears at the bottom of the World Tree. This is speculative at best. <a href="http://alignment2012.com/bolon-yokte.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://alignment2012.com/bolon-yokte.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>
</p><p>A better reading of Bolon Yokte' K'uh is "nine foot tree", corresponding to the  Bolon-ti-ku. "Bolon-ti-ku, or Nine Gods, appear to be treated as one god. We find them represented in the inscriptions, and it seems likely that they represent the nine underworlds and correspond to the Nine Lords of the Night of the Mexicans. (Cf. J. E. Thompson 1929, p. 225, and Seler 1923, p. 31.)" <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/maya/cbc/cbc15.htm#fn_305" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/maya/cbc/cbc15.htm#fn_305" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>
</p>
<a name="Synthesis" id="Synthesis"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Synthesis</span></h2>
<p>Evidence suggests that the Maya believed that the underworld, Xibalba, is ruled by a god, Bolon Yokte' K'uh. We know for a fact that they believed Xibalba rotated above us every night, and the dark patch of gas in between us and the Milky Way is the "road to Xibalba". According to the Tortuguero inscription, they also believed that on December 21, 2012, the god of the underworld would descend from Xibalba and land on Earth.
</p>
<a name="Divination" id="Divination"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Divination</span></h3>
<p>Beyond this all is divination. If anyone tries to tell you that the Maya had <i>definite</i> psychic forecasting powers, stop them immediately: they'll jinx it.
</p><p>There is all sorts of pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo associated with 2012, most of which I enjoy reading solely for my own amusement, but some of it belongs here despite its irrelevance to academic work.
</p><p>Terence McKenna attempted to developed a "novelty theory" that placed one bound at Hiroshima and the other at 2012-12-21. It certainly was novel, because it was based on his <i>own</i> interpretation of the I Ching. He actually had to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000229172932/www.levity.com/eschaton/bombshell.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20000229172932/www.levity.com/eschaton/bombshell.html" rel="nofollow">rewrite the math</a> in 1997 because obvious errors <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/autopsy.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/autopsy.html" rel="nofollow">were pointed out</a>. (<a href="http://www.fractal-timewave.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.fractal-timewave.com/" rel="nofollow">The software</a> seems to have been updated to reflect the new equation.)
</p><p>Here's what <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970612075114/http://www.levity.com/eschaton/finalillusion.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/19970612075114/http://www.levity.com/eschaton/finalillusion.html" rel="nofollow">McKenna thought</a> would happen in 2012, according to a website that was up long before any other New Agers had written on the subject:
</p>
<ul><li> Hyperspatial Breakthrough
<dl><dd> We'll go through a wormhole?
</dd></dl>
</li><li> Planetesimal Impact
<dl><dd> Interesting parallel with the thoroughly pseudoscientific Nibiru/Planet X cult.
</dd></dl>
</li><li> Alien Contact
<dl><dd> Notable as an easy modern interpretation of the reconstructed Mayan myth above.
</dd></dl>
</li><li> Historical Metamorphosis
<dl><dd> Uh...?! Definitely a suitably mysterious theory.
</dd></dl>
</li><li> Metamorphosis of Natural Law
<dl><dd> I think he means that fundamental physical constants will change. Haha
</dd></dl>
</li><li> Solar Explosion
<dl><dd> This is promoted by the Sony film 2012.
</dd></dl>
</li><li> Quasar Ignition at the Galactic Core 
<dl><dd> Interesting parallel with JMJ theory that had not been published at the time. If there actually was an explosion at the galactic center we would not know about it for 25,000-26,000 years. Fun fact for numerologists: that's the length of the procession of the equinoxes&nbsp;:D
