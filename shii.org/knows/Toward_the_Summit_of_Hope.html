<p><b>Toward the Summit of Hope</b>
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>My beloved and most esteemed friends around the world! Allow me to extend my sincerest felicitations to you as you embark on another new, hope-filled year.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>In his opening statement Ikeda never mentions the sutra, the Eternal Buddha or even Nichiren (Jogyo Bosastu). Instead he uses know cult buzz words and tactics.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>With the brilliant dawning of 2005,
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>May I ask what his so brilliantly dawning, the whole world has been experiencing natural and man caused disasters, and hatred in the world abounds. The Zen, and Tibetan Buddhist have confused the entire nation, and we face attack from foreign heretical madmen.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>the curtain has finally risen on the SGI<i>s 30th anniversary year.</i>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>You have only caused a curtain of confusion and the complete distortion of Nichiren's teachings and Lotus Sutra; in fact, the Soka Gakkai and the Nichiren Shoshu have hurt Nichiren Shonin's good name, but most importantly his true intent. This is a enormous problem now, more than people will ever be able to fathom. On college campuses, there is the total hatred for the SGI cult group (despite the lies they tell you), and unfortunately people associate Nichiren with the Soka Gakkai's insane idea's about Buddhism, it has given Buddhism a bad name altogether.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Today, the SGI<i>s network of peace, culture and education</i>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>The Network that the Lotus Sutra teaches is the network of Spreading far and wide the Hokekyo ( Lotus Sutra). Kosen-rufu does not mean world peace, it means to properly propagate the Lotus Sutra (Hokekyo).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>has grown to encompass an unprecedented 190 countries and territories.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>This we know to be on a thread, and not one person or even one of their members understands even the most basic principles of Nichiren's Buddhism --because if they did they would not belong to the SGI (Soka Gakkai); ... it would be as if Nichiren remained a Nembustu believer.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Our organization has won admiration and appreciation around the world, with many lauding it as a wonderful global family where people support one another in a spirit of friendship and mutual respect.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>What I have seen and experienced, is the SGI completely takes control of the family through either the husband or wife, usually by promotion, and then they slowly bleed them of all their time, money and resources. Never teaching them a thing about real Buddhism, or the Lotus Sutra, never to introduce Nichiren Shonin's reliable writings. The insane and horrific thing about it is people will remain in these groups in the same cycle of control for year after year, with no real change in their lives. In fact most of them are kept close to the edge of financial ruin purposely by the Soka Gakkai's organizational tactics (Same tactics the Nazi, and Hirohito used, from the occult). The SGI uses many of the same common tactics that most cults use over their adherents.
</p><p>See: <a href="http://www.sokashoshu.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.sokashoshu.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sokashoshu.com</a> or <a href="http://www.taisekiji.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.taisekiji.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.taisekiji.com</a>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>The humanistic sun of Nichiren Buddhism has begun to ascend brightly, dispelling the darkness of suffering and misery that threatens to engulf our planet and illuminating people everywhere with the great light of hope.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>All you have done is confuse the last hope for our planet, the True Dharma of the Eternal Buddha Lord Shakya. Your complete disregard for the Lotus Sutra and the Eternal Buddha have made this world and much darker place. Have you mentioned any doctrine here of Nichiren Shonins? NO! Have you even hinted at any single principle about True Buddhism of the Hokekyo? NO! Does your sect uphold any admonition of Nichiren Shonins? NO! Does anything your Buddhist sect do accord with Nichiren's words? NO! You are simply a cult leader using Nichiren Shonin's good name to further your business, as you said "your precious commodity." Please stop this heretical non-sense, it has gone on long enough.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>This is all due to the dedicated efforts of each one of you, the noble members of the SGI. Each of you is striving energetically in the place where you have pledged to work for kosen-rufu, in order to fulfill your momentous mission from the distant past.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>Here is the brainwashing for money, all the cult buzz words, 'the pledge you made','the noble member', 'dedicated efforts, classic phrases found also in Hitler's speeches. And of course, ... here we go again with the distant past Gakkai confusion Kuon Ganjo, Nichiren is the true Buddha non-sense. You see the Bodhisattva's of the earth actually would uphold the Lotus Sutra, and believe in the eternal Buddha as Nichiren Shonin did. Mr. Ikeda, ... Nichiren didn't throw out Buddha, just because he wasn't Japanese.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Jan. 26, 1975----a date that shines brilliantly in the annals of Buddhism. On that day, proud pioneers of kosen-rufu from 51 countries and territories gathered in Guam, where fierce fighting took place during World War II. I called out to them with a thousand emotions in my heart: ""I hope that you will dedicate your whole lives to sowing the seeds of the Mystic Law for the sake of peace throughout the entire world. I shall do the same.""
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>Jan. 26, 1975----a date that shines brilliantly in the annals of Buddhism?
</p><p>In your ego heretic mind maybe. I mean, 'the annuals of Buddhism' you're a Fraud Ikeda. Who do you think you are? No one even acknowledges you as a real Buddhist. You are a complete laugh to the know Buddhist world. It is amazing how you keep your "members" shielded from how your doctrine and teachings are in complete conflict with even the most basic principles of Buddhism; your sect is far, far away from Nichiren's true thought. Again would you please stop perpetrating all your distortion on Buddhism, and please stop using cult tactics upon innocent people. Your teachings and everything your group does will and has only caused more calamities upon our world?
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Thirty years have passed since then. In those decades, all of you, my precious fellow members, living true to your vow to realize worldwide kosen-rufu, have worked tirelessly together to sow the seeds of the Mystic Law while weathering countless storms of obstacles. Surely not only Nichiren Daishonin but also Shakyamuni and the Great Teacher T<i>ien-t</i>ai are praising and applauding you unreservedly.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>Does Ikeda mention anything that relates to Shakyamuni Buddha, Nichiren Shonin, Buddhahood, or even the Sutra here? NO! Why because he has no real faith or understanding about Buddhism. He is a business man who would say anything if he thought it would make people give more money. Here he says, 'not only Nichiren Daishonin but also Shakyamuni'.. But also Shakaymuni, what a heretic! Who could follow such a man that would treat the Eternal Buddha of the Life-span chapter in such a manner? This is the one point Nichiren Shonin makes very clear in his Kaimoku Sho, those who would place the Lotus Sutra and the Eternal Buddha in a secondary or subordinate position will surely fall into the avchi hell and so will all his followers.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>The Daishonin writes: ""As first one person, then two persons, then a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand, and then all the people throughout the country come to chant the daimoku, before you know it, their blessings will accrue to you. Those blessings will be like the drops of dew that gather to form the great ocean, or the specks of dust that pile up to become Mount Sumeru"" (The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, p. 672).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>This is obviously a translation from the Major writings (published by the Nichiren Shoshu). They are well known by scholars to be rife with forgeries, and mis-translations, but even worse of all is Ikeda's purposeful omission from Nichiren Shonin's own hand (his original text), ordered by Ikdea and his followers to be altered to go along with their distorted tale about Nichiren Shonin's true faith and practice..
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>All of you are opening the path of kosen-rufu, where none has existed before, into the limitless future of the Latter Day of the Law. You are accumulating untold benefit----like a vast ocean, infinite and immeasurable; like a mighty mountain, eternal and indestructible. This is clearly borne out in the Daishonin<i>s writings and the Lotus Sutra.</i>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>I was in the SGI for 20 years, and I never received a single blessing from the Hokekyo when I was in that group, until after I renounced their heretical views and took faith in the One Sole Truth found in the Hokekyo as Nichiren Shonin clearly teaches in his reliable and honest translated works.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Dr. Victor Sadovnichy, the rector of Moscow State University and a close friend, remarked that what the world yearns for today is a philosophy founded on the idea that government, business, science and religion all exist for human beings, for the welfare of each person. I completely agree. Indeed, establishing the lofty, timeless goal of serving humanity and the individual as the foundation of all human endeavors could be said to be fundamental to the challenge of making the 21st century one of peace and hope.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>The only person Ikdea is serving is himself, all these photo opts and college appointments are all well known to be false and just another lie. What a foolish man, just a show to fool his disciples into continued allegiance and financial support.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Buddhism, a philosophy of the sanctity of life,
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>Buddhism is for Salvation from the Saha world. It is for the purpose of Buddhahood. The sanctity of life starts with respecting your mother and father. Ikeda should listen to Nichiren in his Gosho the .. 'Letter to the brothers' where it reads (paraphrase), 'They are like birds and beast, they do not even no who their fathers and mothers are...' (It is in your own goshos NSIC); but in case you missed the point, it is referring to understand that Shakyamuni Buddha is the Eternal Buddha, the true original Buddha. Nichiren is not the true Buddha.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>teaches that all people's lives are inextricably linked and interconnected. In this teaching, we find unifying values for the realization of a global human community, as well as a great philosophy of coexistence that can serve as the source of a new global ethics.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>What a bunch of politically correct sounding non-sense, that speaks to not one challenge we are facing as a human race today. What a coward Ikeda is. He says everything to be safe. This is not how a disciple of Nichiren would speak; especially not from the standpoint of Buddhism. It in fact contradicts the teachings of the Lotus Sutra in several direct and in direct ways.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Goethe, an eminent writer of the West, also had a fascination with the East, which he expressed in his beautiful collection of poems, West-Eastern Divan: ""It is worthwhile, I accept, to meaningfully / Go back and forth between both worlds; / Moving between East and West / Is therefore best!""
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>Does the name dropping ever get old with this guy. I mean these people hardly know Ikeda, I should call them personally and see what they have to say. I bet in reality they think he is a cult leader.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>I, too, have traveled the world over----to the east, to the west, north and south. I have engaged in countless dialogues with people from different countries. I have done so out of my unshakable conviction that bringing people closer together ultimately brings cultures and civilizations closer together as well.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>Just as Nichiren Shonin's famous work the "Rissho Ankoku Ron" teaches, we must put the Lotus Sutra first before all things if we wish to bring harmony to any government or community. If you do the opposite as you and your organization the SGI have now been doing for years (twisting Nichiren's teachings) and continue to do so, it will only bring ruin to our nations.
</p><p><br />
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>While working together with our fellow members around the globe to consolidate our ironclad unity, let us widen the network of humanity and philosophy based on Buddhist humanism, a vital seed for world peace.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>Your iron clad unity is far from iron clad, your entire group has been in constant turmoil, and all you do is get rid of those members who do not agree with your cult like strong arm tactics.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>The indomitable French writer Victor Hugo cried out to the youth: ""Courage! You belong to the generation that owns the future. You will do great things."" Similarly, the indispensable requirement for reaching the summit of kosen-rufu, on which the destiny of humankind depends, is fearless courage----the resolute courage to stand alone.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>This speaks for itself just do a little research on Ikeda's Victor Hugo, why doesn't he cite Buddha instead? Is he not the Nichiren Buddhist he claims to be?
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Please have the courage to reach out and talk to others, opening people's closed hearts and helping them awaken to the wonderful palace of happiness within their own lives.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>What he is really saying, is please convert as many people as you can to make sure your leaders get their World Tribune and other financial goals.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Please pray and take action with courage, so that you can undauntedly challenge any adversity. Please wage a courageous struggle of words, refuting the erroneous and revealing the true,
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>I dare any single member of his cult group to a debate on the true doctrine of Nichiren Shonin including your precious Ikeda. And, 'Revealing the true', your SGI group has done nothing but propagate lies and distort Shakyamuni's Buddhism. You have done nothing to promote peace, but have only spread confusion that will now take years to clear up.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>determined never to give an inch to those forces that seek to disrupt the unity and harmony of our noble gathering of Buddhas.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>Oh so now all your members are Buddhas, well that should be quite a revelation to old Nichiren and the rest of the Nichiren community.
</p><p><br />
Ikeda
</p><p>It is also a well-known historical fact that Hugo waged a relentless spiritual struggle in denouncing the abuses of arrogant and decadent clergy.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>So here Ikeda is sayimg, "Ok now all you good Gakkers keep that war going on our priesthood now will ya?"
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Our theme for 2005 is the Year of Youth and Development. My mentor, the second Soka Gakkai president, Josei Toda, loved the youth and had the highest expectations for them. He ardently asserted, ""A new century will be built by the power and passion of youth.""
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>I don't want to get started on the falsehoods Toda wrote. I do not have enough time. I have proof of Toda mis-translating the Lotus Sutra itself. What terrible fate is there for all those who follow these wicked and twisted people and their teachings?
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>The future of any organization or society hinges on the passionate commitment of youth. The sound development of kosen-rufu also depends solely on the growth of the youth in each country and region. I call on everyone to treasure the youth and foster them with care and attention. I hope you will make it your greatest pride to raise capable people even more talented than you yourselves and create a mighty river of successors for our movement.
</p><p>My young friends, who are the sun of the century of Soka, continue to grow without end, study with all your hearts, and thoroughly train yourselves! Be strong! Develop strength! Grow into people who, like towering trees, will never be toppled by even the most violent winds. My young friends, I entrust the mission of worldwide kosen-rufu to you in the 21st century!
</p><p>And to all of you, champions of worldwide kosen-rufu around the globe, let us together begin our journey anew----aiming toward the Soka Gakkai<i>s 80th anniversary in 2010 and 100th anniversary in 2030.</i>
</p><p>I am strongly convinced that each of you will be able to exclaim at the end of your days: ""How happy and satisfying my life is!"" ""I have lived a life of supreme value!"" ""I have won!"" This cry of victory from the depths of your beings will resound forever in history. Untold numbers of people will voice their praise and appreciation for you as the great pioneers of our movement.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>I can show you speeches from Adolf Hitler to his youth groups that are almost identical, need I forward those passages, let me know? Also Shakyamuni Buddha entrusted the Bodhisattva's of the earth to the task of Kosen-rufu, it is in the fifteenth chapter (Ceremony in the Air), maybe you have heard of it? What a plagiarizing arrogant fool!
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>All of you are precious members of the Soka family. My wife and I will continue to pray day and night for your health and longevity, for your safety and well being, throughout the challenging year that lies ahead of us.
</p><p>I will also be praying with all my heart that the communities and countries in which you live will be rigorously protected from harm and enjoy peace and prosperity. May each of you without exception ""gather fortune from ten thousand miles away"" (WND, 1137), just as Nichiren writes, and lead lives of complete fulfillment and satisfaction.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>He just quotes doctrine with no reference point, hw says, ' just as Nichiren writes.'
</p><p>I assure you nothing Ikdea writes is, 'just as Nichiren writes.'
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Ikeda
</p><p>Let us unite in vibrant harmony, with ""many in body, one in mind"" as our motto, enjoying ourselves to the fullest as we boldly make our way toward the summit of hope, the highest summit of life.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>January 1, 2005
</p><p><br />
Daisaku Ikeda
President
Soka Gakkai International
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Polito
</p><p>What kind of non-sense is this, this has nothing to do with Buddhism. It is a culmination of buzz words only meant to exploit and employ his devotees. It is actually a powerful brainwashing tool that has confused Nichiren's doctrine long enough. Someone has to respond to this deceiver Ikeda. What is wrong with people can't they see through this pathetic cult drenched speech.
