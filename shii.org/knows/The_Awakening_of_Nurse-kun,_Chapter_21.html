<p>Hey, /b/. I know I've been absent for a bit lately, but, well, stuff's been happening. I was going to try and update you last weekend, but /b/ seemed to be busy being raped by MySQL, so, hey. As previously mentioned, stuff has, in fact, been happening, but I won't bore you with the details, not just yet, anyway. Instead, I suppose I'll tell you what I was doing yesterday, instead. See, she'd been...'injured'...in the torso during the accident, as well as the limbs and her head. It'd been a pretty serious injury, as well, in the vicnity of her liver and surrounding organs. They managed to repair the damage to a sufficient extent at the time, but some of her bloodwork had been showing some troubling numbers since then, and X-rays didn't show much, and an MRI wasn't very feasible (hard to take one when the patient is freaking out with a PTSD flashback...) so an ERCP was scheduled for yesterday.
</p>
<a name="25537459" id="25537459"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25537459 </span></h3>
<p>Now, understandably, she wasn't too thrilled about this prospect. I mean, firstly, she's sick of hospitals in general, with the rehab facility only being tolerated out of necessity, but without much love. Secondly, who really wants a multiple-foot tube tentacle-raping your throat/upper digestive tract? And thirdly, well...she was a bit afraid, even if she didn't admit it out loud. Even falling asleep isn't something she finds comforting anymore, and she associates being anesthetized or sedated with the initial surgical work just after the accident, so... Still, it did need to be done. The specialist in charge of the procedure and monitoring these problems was meeting resistance from her, and where normally a young patient would have their parents to help calm them down and convince them that it would be okay, and that it needed to be done, she...well, doesn't. So her social worker suggested me, instead.
</p>
<a name="25537981" id="25537981"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25537981 </span></h3>
<p>I was a bit surprised, but pleasently so, on the whole, really. I mean, it seemed to show that her worker recognized that I was probably the person she trusted most in the world, which was nice on the level of a bonus to my adoption score (so to metaphorize), but also nice on a personal sort of level, that I might be able to help her a bit more. Anyway, once he (the specialist) got in touch with me, we discussed her situation beyond what he knew on paper (he'd never actually met her yet, go system go), with me filling him in on her fears and issues, and then offering to try and help smooth things over.
</p>
<a name="25538611" id="25538611"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25538611 </span></h3>
<p>Of course, saying was, as it usually is, easier than doing. Due to the problems I've already mentioned, convincing her wasn't a simple task. She seemed to understand the medical issues and their urgency, understood that this was the only feasible way to figure out what was going on so that they could treat her properly, but as is human nature, her knowledge and logical comprehension didn't automatically overcome her feelings on the subject. We sat up and talked for a long while about her fears and distaste for the procedure, the primary amongst their number being in a surgical environment again, laying on a table, IV hooked into her remaining limb, surrounded by masked doctors and nurses, then being 'put to sleep'...putting yourself in her position and remembering her not-so-distant past, wouldn't you be afraid, too?
</p>
<a name="25539278" id="25539278"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25539278 </span></h3>
<p>She actually started crying when she was describing her memories of the last time she was in just that situation, which is very unusual for her general withdrawn state, outside of nightmares. I comforted her as best I could, and offered to go with her, and stay by her side the entire time, to make sure they treated her right, and to protect her. I know, of course, that I couldn't really do much to do so, but what was important was that she believed it, or believed me saying it, rather than the 'facts'. We spoke a bit longer, but she eventually agreed, tentatively, to consenting to the procedure. That was a few weeks ago, and the time finally came yesterday. I showed up at the nursing home at around 6:30, still not quite fully awake but practically chugging coffee, as the procedure was scheduled for 8, and she needed to be at the hospital by 7...
</p>
<a name="25539883" id="25539883"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25539883 </span></h3>
<p>She was in a barely-controlled state of panic when I got to her room, finding her already dressed and ready to go, wearing all her limbs and an assortment of some of the spring clothing we picked up on an earlier outing; she must've folded at least five cranes in the two or three minutes I took upfolding her chair and double-checking with her nurse on duty out at the station in the hallway. She was still fidgeting when I got back, looking out her window and generally acting restless...not kicking her feet or such, of course, but her good hand and her myoelectric alike were twisting her skirt in her lap, as she bit her lip...I kneeled in front of her and did a bit of head-weaving to catch her eye, and tried to smile as confidently as I could, reassuring her that it'd be all right, and we'd go out and have some fun afterward.
</p>
<a name="25540371" id="25540371"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25540371 </span></h3>
<p>She looked down a bit, then eventually nodded, and I helped her up into her chair...she's started insisting lately on my merely helping hold onto her as she walks to it, which is still great to see every time. Once she was in it, we wheeled on out to the facility's van, got loaded up, and headed on out, taking my old position of holding her hand as she filled her ears with music and shut her eyes, something that we haven't done for a while, with me doing the driving on our outings (though I do reach over to hold it while we're stopped at lights, as she sits up front with me). Once we arrived, we wheel-walked our way into the hospital and headed for the GI unit, arriving a few minutes early. It was still pretty empty at that point, with only one woman already waiting, and a man showing up a few minutes after we did, while we were waiting to be called.
</p>
<a name="25540999" id="25540999"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25540999 </span></h3>
<p>We were playing some Ouendan to pass the time, with her beating me considerably more handily, still, than with EBA. Of course, I only had one earbud in to keep one open for her name to be called, and we were only halfway into our third game when just that happened. We wrapped things up, and I wheeled her in after her prep-nurse, a nice older woman with 'Kiffy' on her nametag (turned out to be short for Katherine, which she claimed nobody had ever called her). I introduced myself and explained my credentials and position in the matter, and was quickly accepted without wrangling or 'I'll need to check that...', thankfully. We were shown to an ERCP recovery room consisting of a small room with three beds, which Kiffy explained they'd stolen from Cardiology, since they weren't using it much. Took me back to my own days in a hospital, that did. Then she asked me to help our girl disrobe, our common nursehood and my position with her in the home brushing right past any societal squeamishness toward a grown man doing so with a young girl, thankfully, since she'd also been unhappy about the thought of more strange nurses doing such things with/to her.
</p>
<a name="25541695" id="25541695"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25541695 </span></h3>
<p>I helped her, with curtains drawn around us, to change out of her clothes and into a gown, tying it up in the back...then there was a small debate about whether her prosthetics could stay on or need to be taken off...she wasn't very happy at that possibility. I argued on her behalf, pointing out that it wouldn't affect her BP or any other readings pre-procedure, and that it'd do just the opposite, in fact, helping her stay calmer and more relaxed, instead. In the end, I won out, and on they stayed. Next came the cuff and the finger-clamp, which aren't much fun, with both her BP and pulse being a bit high as expected, but didn't last too long, as they were only preludes to IV insertion to the back of the hand, anyway. Thankfully, Kiffy was an old hand, and a good one, too. I mean, our girl doesn't like needles, particularly, but she's had enough of them that she isn't going to freak out, either; all in all it went as smooth as could be expected, with a smooth thrust, a wince, and an all clear. She got taped up, hooked up to an IV for some fluids (she'd had to fast since five the day before, and nothing to drink since midnight), and then we more or less chilled for a bit.
</p>
<a name="25542193" id="25542193"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25542193 </span></h3>
<p>It seems that her specialist was MIA, so the nurses that'd be handling the procedure showed up and introduced themselves (Lorraine, and, um, the other one escapes my memory, sorry lady), while the junior doctor came in as well, a young Asian woman whose name I cannot remember either, for the life of me. She ran through the checklist of allergies, previous surgeries (that took a while), medications, etc. I did my best to provide the answers, having studied up on her charts to memorize the exact list of procedures she'd been through already, though I already had her meds occupying grey matter real estate. She isn't allergic to anything, so that wasn't any trouble, at least. The doctor wandered off again, while an additional bag of cipro was added to her drip just in case, to provide a safeguard against infection, one of the risks of the procedure. We played some more Ouendan for another twenty minutes or so, trying to keep her mind off of what was coming up, a second reading of her BP and pulse revealing she was still rather anxious, if not in critical levels just yet.
</p>
<a name="25542780" id="25542780"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25542780 </span></h3>
<p>Finally, the doctor manifested, a guy in his mid-forties that looked about as bland as anonymous could hope for, strolling in and introducing himself before he even layed eyes upon her behind me, was I was sort of between her and the door. He extended his right hand forward just as he did so, then it sort of hung there as he took her in, and apparently remembered just which of her hands were missing. Then she did her awesome, and silently raised her myoelectric right hand in return, and moved to slip it into his, for a shake. I think she squeezed just a bit harder than she 'should' have, really, from the slight wince I saw on his face, but not hard enough to pulp or anything (a metal motor-powered claw underneath cosmetic sheath can do a fair amount of damage, even if it's little-girl sized). Better than throwing her DS at him, so I'm thankful she restrained herself to a minor protest, really. That done, he said something about seeing her again in a bit, and quickly walked back out, rubbing his hand a little as he went, and I could swear I saw her smile a little out of the corner of my eye as he did so. And then, within a few more minutes, it was time to go...
</p>
<a name="25543463" id="25543463"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25543463 </span></h3>
<p>The side-rails came up, I stowed our DSs (DSi? DS as in Ninja?) away, and it was off to the procedure room. She managed to stay very well composed, all things considered, as we wheeled down the hallway, but that changed once we got into the room itself. Said room was dimly lit, had a large lamp above the bed, an imaging robotic arm at one end of it to slide up and surround her, and assorted surgical paraphenelia (barring actual sharp cutty tools); all in all, it looked VERY much like an actual OR. Poor girl just started to approach freaking out, her breathing speeding up, fidgeting, eyes (well, good one, but the bad one was moving too) looking back to the door we just came in for escape...I could practically hear her heart thudding in her chest from a foot away. I squeezed her hand with my own, where I'd been holding it since we started moving, and murmered soothingly as I leaned down beside her, telling her it'd be all right, that I'd be right here...and stroked her hair with my other hand, trying my repertoire of nightmare tactics, short of giving her a hug.
</p>
<a name="25544093" id="25544093"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25544093 </span></h3>
<p>The two doctors did their best to ignore all this, going over some forms and a computer in one corner of the room, while the two procedural nurses looked concerned, but seemed to get that I had some idea what I was doing, so they just hung back. It took a few minutes, but she eventually managed to calm herself down, to my pride. I helped lift her up and over to the procedure table from her bed (a fully-limbed person scoots over themself, but not really feasible for her); the IV line was adjusted, somewhat unusually in her case as they're generally placed into the right hand, and I helped her shift herself onto her stomach (the other nurses kept using 'tummy', but she's had a distaste for 'childish' language like that for a while now, so I won't use it), her head turned to the side, facing the right...not the best position for her, eliminating her peripheral vision entirely as it did.
</p>
<a name="25544737" id="25544737"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25544737 </span></h3>
<p>They 'hooked up' her nasal oxygen tubes as we fine-tuned her body position...they wanted to bring up the imaging arm around her, but I took a quick break from holding her hand to have a word with them 'aside', telling them it really wouldn't be a good idea while she's conscious...after a couple of stories about her place in the accident and an attempt at an MRI in the past, they agreed to hold off on that. I resumed my place at her side to her right so that she could see me, my arm stretched up and over her to hold her left, as the Jr. Doctor decided that a spray to her throat might be a good idea. I played a bit of twisted to clear the way, and she administered a numbing spray to our girl's open mouth via her WD-40+spray-tube container, which, judging from the expression she made, tasted horrible. Fortunately, perhaps, it also distracted her from one of the nurses adding the sedative cocktail to her IV from three different syringes, her lack of peripheral vision and activity elsewhere keeping her from noticing and beginning to panic over the upcoming sedation.
</p>
<a name="25545778" id="25545778"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25545778 </span></h3>
<p>I was still stroking her hair and holding her hand as the effects began to take hold; trying to stay the center of her vision, to block out the doctors putting on their coats and masks, and other unnessecarily worrying images...she was slurring a bit due to the numbing agent by then, but murmered a 'Feel sleepy...don' go...'...and her eyes slipped shut just as I was telling her 'I promise'. The procedure went as well as could be hoped for, with my donning a mask as well and staying out of the way to her left to hold onto her hand, as the nurses pointed out that, even sedated, a patient that isn't comfortable will shift around, which is a bad thing...and in this case, my letting go might just do so. The fact that I'm a professional as well probably helped with that, so yay for 4 years of school! The specialist seemed to be good at his job, at least, and his hand wasn't mangled, thankfully, so no messups due to manual dexterity on his part. Once it was over, she was wheeled back to the recovery room, and remained 'asleep' for another two hours before she first stirred.
</p>
<a name="25546844" id="25546844"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25546844 </span></h3>
<p>She only woke up for a minute or so, disoriented and still quite groggy indeed, turning her head slightly to look at me, asking me if it was done, to which I replied that it was, and she should sleep some more, it was all finished, all good. She nodded a bit at that, sleepily, and closed her eyes again, drifting off. She slept for another hour and a half after that, various other patients coming into the room after their procedures, nurses coming and going, prepping patients and helping discharge them; her doctor came in and said that they'd be examining the results and getting back to us with answers 'soon'. Not exactly Team House speed here, but then, it's not the most realistic show at times anyway, as much as I may enjoy it. He said she could go when she was ready, then strolled back out again, la de da. She finally woke up and was more or less coherent, letting go of my hand to reach up and rub her eye tiredly, looking more or less all right, being a bit out of it aside. Happy to see this, and with the blessing and IV-removing of Kiffy, I helped her get dressed again, and with a 'Let's go' from her, helped her into her chair, and out we went into the spring sunshine.

<p>Anyway, enough of this aimless faggotry, I'll try and relate what happened after we left, now. Disclaimer: I made one thing up. (This thing applies to part 1 as well). So, we'd left the hospital, into a pleasent spring day, sun shining without being overpowering. The van from the facility was waiting for us, so we loaded up, and headed 'home'. However, once there, as I'd cleared ahead of time, rather than depositing her back in her room, we headed for my vehicle, and off into the day, not even noon yet, still plenty of time to make it a pleasent one, not just an ordeal.
</p>
<a name="25554657" id="25554657"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25554657 </span></h3>
<p>We headed for a park that wasn't too far away, where we'd been just a few weeks earlier, but which would hopefully be a bit less crowded than before, lacking cherry blossoms this time around. Thankfully, it turned out to be just that way, and I parked, then stepped out and moved to unload her chair...
</p><p>...when she stopped me, having opened her own door, saying she wanted to...walk, instead. I was a bit alarmed, unsure she was entirely up to it, particularly after having just been under sedation a few hours earlier. But she had a certain look in her eye that I've come to recognize, so I knew that refusing her wouldn't end too well. As such, I just sighed and shrugged with a smile, shutting the door on the chair and moving to hers instead, and extending a hand to her, as if I were helping a celebrity out of a limo onto the red carpet.
</p>
<a name="25555359" id="25555359"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25555359 </span></h3>
<p>She seemed somewhat amused by this, and took it with her right hand, reaching up with her left to take tight hold of the shithandle, then swivelled to extend first her right, then her left, foot out over the side of the door. Then, after a moment of concentration and focus, she pulled herself up with her left hand, pulled against my own with her right, and used her tensed abdominal muscles and thighs to help pull herself up to an upright position outside the car...and wobbled...and steadied herself, standing in triump, with a small smile as she did so. Smiling rather larger myself, fuelled by the surge of pride I felt, I shifted to her side and helped her take a step out of the way of the door, moving to close it behind her, my right arm linked with (being clung to by) her left. I made a little joke about her not slacking off even when her rehab was cancelled for the day, to which she replied by (I think) jokingly saying it'd be good training for her, walking on more 'real' ground.
</p>
<a name="25556592" id="25556592"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25556592 </span></h3>
<p>And with that, off we went. We stuck with the bike path for the beginning, as she hasn't had any real practice walking on grass or dirt just yet, and didn't want to trip her up (perhaps literally) before she'd been 'warmed up'. I stayed by her left side, with her hanging onto my arm with her good one and her artificial one as well, moving at a slow, but not glacial, pace, which I matched as best I could. But she was walking...walking on a warm spring day, outside, without a half-dozen people ready to pounce if she fell. Just the one, instead. We garnered more than a few stares from the people that we passed by, which she did an admirable job of mostly ignoring, as she did the whispers from the closer ones, despite her excellent hearing. She didn't leap on any of them to rip and tear, didn't throw my wallet at any of them, didn't pause to say things that drove them into a foaming rage. Her self control and dignity brought up an even bigger lump of pride into my chest than seeing her stand did, and helped quell my own desire to shout certain unpolite things at some of them, myself.
</p>
<a name="25557940" id="25557940"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25557940 </span></h3>
<p>Well, we only got about a mile or so before she started getting tired, which is quite understandable, considering she uses about three or more times more energy just to walk than I do. Fortunately, it was near a relatively isolated spot, free of gawkers or jerks, so I suggested we head to that spot, off the beaten path, to rest a bit. She agreed, then struggled up the slight incline of the grassy hill, clinging to me more tightly for support, and we eventually made it up there to the slight dip behind it next to a tree, and down we (carefully) flopped, onto the just-starting to re-green grass. I took off my jacket and bunched it up a bit for her to use as a pillow, as we laid on our backs, and stared up at the sky, her breathing hard, me being an empty-headed boob.
</p>
<a name="25559536" id="25559536"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25559536 </span></h3>
<p>We spent a good ten minutes or so just laying there, watching the clouds drift by, I folded my hands behind my head, then realized it might be insensitive, somehow, to do so...and glanced over to the side at her, only to see that she'd gone and done the same, artificial hand underneath her good one; having caught my look (as I was to her left, in her peripheral vision), she looked to me as well, and as I smiled ruefully, feeling kind of dumb, she actually...laughed. It was wonderful, even if it only lasted for a couple of seconds, but it was a laugh, unforced and genuine, and it lit up her whole face in a way the sunlight couldn't do on its own. That just led to my grin going from rueful to uncontrollable, and I started laughing as well. She only laughed for that moment, but I couldn't keep it quite so brief; she just watched as I got it out of my system, smiling faintly all the while. Once I did, looking a bit embarassed, I told her how proud I was of how brave she'd been that morning, how I'd known she could do it...it was just a matter of it actually having time to happen to prove me right. She looked somewhat embarassed at that herself, then, flushing a bit, then after a moment of silence, simply thanked me for keeping my promise.
</p>
<a name="25561036" id="25561036"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25561036 </span></h3>
<p>We lapsed into silence for a while longer after that, just watching the clouds drift by, each of us lost in our own thoughts. Finally, after about ten minutes more, she moved to sit up, looked over at me, and said 'Let's go'. Remembering her use of the same words that morning, I just smiled and nodded, moving to stand up and brush my butt off (stray dead grass, you see), then turned to face her...not making an offer to help, knowing her as I did, but just waiting, receptive without being too obvious about it. In response, she raised both her own hands up toward me, and I nodded, then took them...and with a quick but gentle tug, pulled her right up onto her feet, as she kept her legs straight and just arced right up onto them. I knelt to retrieve my jacket as she did some brushing off of her own, then slung it over my shoulder, and offered her my hand again. And off we went. I asked her if she'd like to just retrace our steps, or take the long way around; she thought about it for a bit, then seemed to straighten a bit, and picked the 'long' way, which would be about a mile and a half or so to get back to the car. Since we still had a fair amount of time left before she had to go 'home', I figured that we could take a few more rest breaks, if need be, so I just smiled and nodded.
</p>
<a name="25561768" id="25561768"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25561768 </span></h3>
<p>Thankfully, this route was actually more level than the initial path we'd taken, placing less of a strain on her, due to her less than robust robot knees. We just took our time, walking through skeletally dappled areas underneath barely-blooming trees, paused to take in some of the plaques on benches dedicated to philanthropists that have helped fund the park in the past, and around the halfway mark, took a seat on one of those benches and watched a family of ducks swimming on a pond. She looked as relaxed and, well, happy, as I've seen her in a long time, leaning against me, which was what made me notice that the temperature had dipped a few degrees. That noticed, I retrieved my jacket from its position, and slipped it around her shoulders. She didn't say anything about the act, which was fine by me, but didn't sit up on her own again, either. Guess I was just a convenient pillow.
</p>
<a name="25563071" id="25563071"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25563071 </span></h3>
<p>After a few minutes more (we'd been there for around ten or so already), we got up once again, with her managing to do so on her own, as it's considerably easier going from a sitting position with armrests and a back and such than from laying on some grass. She moved to remove my jacket to return it to me, but I held up my hands, palm outward, telling her that if she was cold, she could keep it, if she liked, since I was already wearing a long-sleeved shirt...she seemed conflicted for a moment, I'm guessing weighing whether she wanted to seem dependant or not, then finally shrugged and offered a casual smile, simply saying: "Thanks.". We started off again onto the return leg of the trip, making it about a quarter mile or so, just past the tip of the pond in that direction, when I felt the first raindrop hit. Mentally cursing inept 'meteorologists', I increased my stride without thinking about it...and almost dragged her into falling onto her face as she was hanging onto my arm, but her legs couldn't quite keep up with that speed increase, letting out a small startled cry. I stopped immediately and moved to help her steady herself again, apologizing profusely...and she said it was all right after a moment, though I could see that she felt at least a bit bad about it, about the fact that she *couldn't* keep up suddenly...
</p>
<a name="25564216" id="25564216"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25564216 </span></h3>
<p>Apologizing one more time, and telling her it was my fault entirely, I asked if she was ready to go again, and with a small nod as she kept looking down at her feet. I felt like crap, but didn't want her to be exposed to conditions like this when she just got out of the hospital this morning, reasons irrelevant, I started walking again, a bit more brisk than our earlier leisurely stroll, but not greatly so...and she was able to keep up with me, though just a glance and working ears suggested she was pushing herself to do so, even as the rainfall continued to grow in intensity. We made it about another quarter mile before her slowing pace and labored breathing made it clear she was reaching her limit, even as the shower was beginning to become a downpour...so I slowed, then stopped. And moved to kneel, turning my back toward her. "Hop on, I'd like to give you a ride.". I tried to phrase it so that it was something I wanted to do, rather than something I needed to do because of her 'weakness', turning slightly to face her and smile as I did so, despite the water pouring down my face, which had already soaked both of us; leaving her looking both waterlogged and somewhat miserable with both exhaustion and a feeling and having 'failed' somehow...

<p>It was hard to tell, as the rain was pouring down her face just as it had been down my own, but I think she was crying again, though she was making a heroic effort not to. Her good fist was clenched tightly enough at her side to turn her knuckles white...even her myoelectric hand was clenched, powered by subconciously symmetrical muscles and impulses. It was hard for me to maintain my own false composure, but I drew on my one drama class from high school, and smiled cheerfully, half-turning, then reaching out to touch her cheek gently, applying a very light pressure to have her look up at me again. "Please?", I said. "It'd make me really happy." She averted her eyes to the side, biting her lip...then finally gave a ghost of a nod without saying anything, and I turned back again, shifting a bit to be right in front of her; a moment later, I felt a mismatched pair of arms hooking around my neck, and reached back with my own, to a pair of plastic and flesh thighs, then stood up, and started walking again.
</p>
<a name="25566578" id="25566578"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25566578 </span></h3>
<p>I could feel her breath on my neck and left ear, her head tilting to that side naturally, her hands clutching at my shirt to augment her grip, while I adjusted my own hands further up and back to provide better support for her, particularly since her torso and my own aren't exactly the same length. I was already walking at this point, feeling her heart beating like a caged bird against my back and the rain dripping off her hair onto my shoulder, when I asked her if she'd like to run. She drew in a shuddering breath when I said that word, her heartbeat stepping up the pace...and as soon as I heard her whisper "Yes", I did. I ran as quickly as I could without risking falling onto our faces, faster than I had since I was in college, as fast as I could go, for her.

<p>Somehow, miraculously, I managed to make it back to the car without falling and breaking my, and or her, fool neck. I'm not particularly well coordinated, so I can only guess that the fates of fluid dynamics were with me that day. When I finally got there I bent forward at the waist slightly so she could rest on my back, fumbling in my pocket for my keys and door opener. I managed to beep them open, then finally moved to kneel again, and let her slip off me to lower herself to the ground. She was still breathing a bit hard when she stood on her own, her legs wobbly. I looked her over for a moment to make sure she was ok, feeling her wrist to find that while it was elevated, her pulse wasn't at dangerous levels, then brushed some of the stray droplets off her bangs, before I moved to help her into the car, then hustled around to take my own seat.

<p>Despite the lessons my father taught me when I was a callow youth, learning the rules of the road, rules I've followed diligently since then, 10 and 2 in particular, I drove one-handed that afternoon. My left hand had to suffice, a lesson I'd learned from her, as my right was busy, wrapped up around her own, as she curled up in the passenger seat; robotic knees, plastic shins and feet drawn up atop it, her eyes shut as usual, but not quite so tightly as usual. We arrived at the home some time later, taking longer than we'd spent travelling from it to the park earlier, then just sat in the parking lot for a couple of minutes in silence. Finally, I broke it, and my own indecision, by leaning over and placing a kiss on top of her still-wet head. I didn't say anything, because I felt it'd sound dumb no matter its content, but just moved to get out, gently releasing her hand, to fetch her chair.
</p>
<a name="25570100" id="25570100"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 25570100 </span></h3>
<p>I got it out and unfolded, then opened her door and unbuckled her...I could see the distaste in her expression at the sight of the chair, but I half-jokingly told her that I might get in trouble if they saw me letting her walk in front of them, even if I knew she could. She seemed to accept this, sighing a bit, with a touch of theatricality, then assented, and let me help her take her seat. From there, I wheeled her inside, both of us somewhat more wet than a dash from the car might indicate, as our friendly neighbourhood Indian Security Professional noted with a laugh, then we headed straight for her room, leaving a trail for janitorial to mop up in our wake. My colleague on duty at the station made a comment about going swimming, and we were back in her room.

<p>Since she was back in the home, she was now legally under the care of her nurse on duty, rather than me...so all I could really do was gather a few towels from her bathroom and place them on the edge of her bed before helping her up and over to take a seat there...no helping her dry off, even I'd be the one in that position in just a few hours. Still, I did use the corner of one of them to dry her face and ruffle her hair just a little...and offered a smile as I did. "You're important, you know that?" She looked faintly embarassed when I said it, not making much of a response, but that was fine by me, and I just kept smiling, then told her I'd see her later, that if she felt tired, she shouldn't feel bad about getting some more sleep. And, finally, that'd I'd had a good day, and I'd hoped it'd been at least not a bad one for her, then stood up to get going, so her nurse could come in and help her dry off. I paused, then, as I felt a slight tugging on my pants, glancing down to see it was her good hand, with her looking up to me. And then, after a moment's silence, "...I did. Thanks...again." I just smiled again, and brushed a tenacious lock of wet hair out of her eyes and behind one of her ears, then headed out.

<p>And...well, that's about all the salient details of that. I hesitated in telling it, thus the gap between the two, because I know it sounds sappy and, well...but all the important things did happen. And I didn't put any words into her mouth that she didn't say herself. Anyway. Um. Yeah. I suck.

I honestly had only planned on him being alive a short while longer, but he was a tough old man who served in the 5th Ranger Battalion in Europe and was a decorated and respected war hero. My wife has been nagging me to get a bigger house and is on the verge of leaving me if I don't. I really need him to die and have taken to switching out his Urocit-K, Norpace, and Razadyne with over the counter supplements, painkillers, and antihistamines. For awhile I even replaced his insulin with dextrose I purchased at a farm supply store. This seems to have done VERY little, He's remained sharp, active, and hasn't complained or gotten sick at all. His doctor did however raise questions about his high blood sugar and the ineffectiveness of his "insulin", which prompted me to switch it back before someone noticed. He's so tough!

<dl><dd>&nbsp;:: I love Nurse-kun threads. What really draws me into them is the fact that it has the "ideal reality" aspect that makes many tales great. The characters seem to say the right things at the right time, as if it were out of some sort of novel; however, the emotions of the characters are very real, so it doesn't have the sort of contrived, cliche effect that such dialogue would have in many Hollywood movies today. I'm not accusing Nurse-kun of having made up the story, instead, this seems to be a testament to his skill as a storyteller. Because of this, I imagine Nurse-kun to be a very charismatic person face-to-face. Anyone else get this impression?<i> </i>

<p><i>hey Nurse-kun, </i> <i>are you planning to insert some more fanservice occasionally like the suppository story? Or have you decided against that for ethical reasons or for fear of being more labeled as a pedo.</i>
</p><p><i>i thoroughly enjoy your tales by the way. hope everything works out for yor two.</i>
</p><p><i>and everyone who really things nurse-kun wants to pooper amp-chan..common everyone knows the whole pedo thing on /b/ is a big joke....OR IS IT?</i>
</p><p>Well, that was more or less a one-time joke inspired by a real-life situation that I knew could have different meaning on 4chan. I don't generally make things up, so 'inserting fanservice', well, not really. I mean, I might make a joke about something that really happened , but, well.

<p><i>as much as I read through the wiki, I could not find info on when did her accident happen. When did it? How long did she stay in the hospital afterwards?</i>
</p><p>A while back. Months. Vagueness is a defense against internet toughguys, sorry. Less than a year, I'll say in a definite way.

<p><i>oh, also, another thing that would be nice, is for you to post schedules of when you're going to be posting on /b/, so i can catch the thread. I try not to spend all my time on 4chan, but I hate it when I miss your posts!</i>
</p><p>My 'schedule' is practically nonexistent these days...I can generally manage to arrange an outing with her a few days in advance, but taking care of my dad and helping my mom is often something that can come up at any time...I've tried to keep tuesdays free, but even then, sometimes things happen, as they did last week, and this one. I suppose I could try posting a notice if I have a day free the night before, if someone plans on putting this up for 'advertisement' somewhere, but...

<p><i>Nurse-kun I'd like to say your threads really touch me personally. My girlfriend of 15 is missing 3 limbs (left arm, right arm, right leg) and while it has been a while since her accident and she's doing better, she's still struggling to live a "normal" life. I hope amputee-chan hangs in there!</i>

<p><i>Nurse-kun, when you talk to her does she ever talk about or hint at what keeps her going in life? I mean not wanting to die or just become a vegetable and not have to suffer through life anymore. What does she have to look forward to in life? All the things a normal girl takes for granted... boyfriend, social life, fun, family, entertainment; she has it horrible in every respect. Yet is still alive and still here, why?</i>
</p><p><i>Also what major medical procedures have you taken part in / assisted with? Surgery? Emergency room stuff?</i>
</p><p>...not really. I haven't brought it up, and she hasn't said much either, aside from the occasional darker moment in which she expresses a doubt that she has any future at all, which I do try to help with, as best I can.

<dl><dd> <i>Okay, Nurse-kun, I know this is fucking old. I'm the guy reading the archives. But I felt I should add this:</i>
<dl><dd> Would you be interested in a girl/woman missing three limbs and an eye, even if she used her arm prosthesis really well, covered up her leg prosthetics with stockings or something and was good enough with them to walk or even run almost normally, was good enough with makeup to cover the scar over her eye...? Excluding 'god stumps maek me hard' answers from the sickos out there, asking the non-fetishests here...would you be romantically interested in someone like her, with a great body (that's still intact) and a more or less healed psyche and a fascinating mind? And not just romantically, but sexually, as well?<i> </i>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <i>That's from the archives. I just thought I'd mention that I semi-dated a girl in highschool that had a dead arm... I don't know the medical term, but she couldn't move it by itself. Suffice to say, it didn't cause any relationship problems or anything of the sort. So there certainly is hope.</i>

<p><i>QUESTION BE-DUMP-A-BUMP!</i>
</p><p><i>Here's a question; you've said she was a really smart kid, gifted school and all, but did she enjoy learning? I know you'd have to get her some (home)schooling if the adoption went through, but have you thought about bringing educational books or something to her? She might really enjoy learning in her off-time; It could give her a boost of small pride being able to tell you even more triva, and it'd help for when you get her back into actual school-work.</i>
</p><p>Yes, she's chosen a number of educational books during our trips to the library, and we included a few in that initial christmas batch, and in smaller ones I haven't really mentioned since then. She does enjoy learning, and if she enjoys something...well, I try and get it to her, or her to it.

</p><p>Thankfully, no. And not as yet...they've shared the pool again on a couple of occasions, I believe, but they've just kept a distance and apart in general, save for a few glares, according to the grapevine..

<p><i>Hey Nurse-kun,</i>
</p><p><i>I saw your last thread, but didn't get what was going on at the time. Then I found the wiki and read most of it. You're awesome, keep up the good work. I hope things turn out well for you two.</i>
</p><p><i>btw, I read the quote that &gt;&gt;25569531 brought up from the the archive the other day...</i>
</p><p><i>You do realize that by the time she's of legal age, you'll be nearly 40, right?</i>
</p><p>Hey, MAN...I'd only be in my mid-thirties...or so. HALF A DECADE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE.
</p><p>...kidding. Well, not about my age, but, uh. I'm not old! I'm still hip to your pokeymans and ipods!
</p><p><i>I didn't say you were old NOW and don't worry, we'll all get old along with you (how weird that will be...all us current /b/tards will be in our 30's) but, uh, it's going to happen eventually...it's not like anyone has avoided it thus far.</i>
</p><p><i>All I'm saying is that when she grows up, she probably won't be interested in you romantically. You'll be more like her father. This will be dramatically reinforced by the age gap between you...she's 7, you're in your mid-twenties. That's a huge gap.</i>
</p><p>I know that. And that's fine, since I'd think it'd be pretty damn weird/creepy to start some sort of romantic relationship 10+ years down the line of caring...for her. I was just making a joke.

</p><p><i>Are you ever going to share with her how you've shared her story with the internets?

</p><p><i>Question:</i>
</p><p><i>When you manage to get through this whole adoption process and everything is said and done, do you have any plans on how to get her back into something close to a normal life or as normal as can be.</i>

</p><p><i>If she is indeed as smart as you say, school is something she can put focus on, since if she's as smart as hell, she most definitely has a future. She can be a sort of loli version of Stephen Hawking.</i>
</p><p>Of course. I'd hardly try and free her from one cage only to put her into another one. And I'm sure she could kick Hawking's ass given some more practice, so long as someone doesn't invent a flying chair before then.
