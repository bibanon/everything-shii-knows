Rachael Kohn: What were you before you were a Pagan?
</p><p>Tamsin: I didn't know what I was, and I began to think that I was going mad. I really seriously thought that I was losing my mind, because I would see a sunset, and a particular colour and suddenly get a flash of something that I thought that colour was just for me, or I would be at the beach and I would walk around a rock and sit next to a rock and get something from a rock, Or I'd be in a forest.
</p><p>I was very much interested in nature, but I really thought, Oh, I'm losing my marbles. And then, quite by chance, I remember saying to my friend, 'I think I'm going to become a witch', but I didn't know really what a witch was, so there was a certain amount of drawing, but I didn't know what I was going drawn to. And as soon as I started reading Pagan books, I just thought, this is what I want, this is what - I came home.
</p><p>Rachael Kohn: And so did you become a witch, or did you choose some other form of Paganism?
</p><p>Tamsin: I became a witch initially, because originally I thought that witchcraft was Paganism, that they were just one and the same thing. I didn't realise that witchcraft was a part of Paganism. So I became a witch because I felt that pull towards the elements and the seasons and the earth and the moon particularly, because the moon had always driven me completely crazy, and I didn't know why. And now to know why is so empowering, to understand why the moon affects me so much, that I have a relationship with her, to know why I can cry with joy at a flower coming through because that flower and I are related.
</p><p>And that's why what Graham was saying tonight was really very profound for me because he was talking about having a relationship and not forcing a relationship with the environment but sitting and waiting for those messages and that to come to you.
</p><p>Rachael Kohn: So you are definitely a natural-born Animist?
</p><p>Tamsin: I guess I must be.
