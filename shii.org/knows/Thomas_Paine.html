<div id='article'><p><b>Thomas Paine</b> is the founder of the <a href="United_States_of_America.html" title="United States of America" class="mw-redirect">United States of America</a>. Most people think we were founded by Washington or something like that, but Paine deserves full credit. He pointed out to the whole nation at once, who were up until that day deluding themselves, that we were fighting not for God and country but for our own rights. He told us that we needed to write a Declaration of Independence. He said we would become the most powerful country in the world. 
</p>
<dl><dd>"The United States of America," will sound as pompously in the world or in history, as "the kingdom of Great Britain"; the character of General Washington will fill a page with as much lustre as that of Lord Howe: and the Congress have as much right to command the king and Parliament in London to desist from legislation, as they or you have to command the Congress.

</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p>He then went on to England and France. He advocated revolution in both of those countries as well, seeing the oppression they were under; he was subsequently kicked out of each and had to return to America, where he lingered and died far past his prime.
</p><p>I'd like you to take a moment to read some of the excerpts below and wonder at why we don't see these excerpts in American history classes.

<p><i>African Slavery in America</i>:
</p>
<dl><dd>The great Question may beâ€”What should be done with those who are enslaved already? To turn the old and infirm free, would be injustice and cruelty; they who enjoyed the labours of their better days should keep, and treat them humanely. As to the rest, let prudent men, with the assistance of legislatures, determine what is practicable for masters, and best for them. Perhaps some could give them lands upon reasonable rent, some, employing them in their labour still, might give them some reasonable allowances for it; so as all may have some property, and fruits of their labours at their own disposal, and be encouraged to industry; the family may live together, and enjoy the natural satisfaction of exercising relative affections and duties, with civil protection, and other advantages, like fellow men. Perhaps they might sometime form useful barrier settlements on the frontiers. Thus they may become interested in the public welfare, and assist in promoting it; instead of being dangerous, as now they are, should any enemy promise them a better condition.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>Common Sense</i>:
</p>
<dl><dd>Were a manifesto to be published, and despatched to foreign Courts, setting forth the miseries we have endured, and the peaceful methods which we have ineffectually used for redress; declaring at the same time that not being able longer to live happily or safely under the cruel disposition of the British Court, we had been driven to the necessity of breaking off all connections with her; at the same time, assuring all such Courts of our peaceable disposition towards them, and of our desire of entering into trade with them; such a memorial would produce more good effects to this Continent than if a ship were freighted with petitions to Britain.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>The American Crisis</i>:
</p>
<dl><dd>These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>The Rights of Man</i>:
</p>
<dl><dd>Another reform in the American constitution is the exploding all oaths of personality. The oath of allegiance in America is to the nation only. The putting any individual as a figure for a nation is improper. The happiness of a nation is the superior object, and therefore the intention of an oath of allegiance ought not to be obscured by being figuratively taken, to, or in the name of, any person. The oath, called the civic oath, in France, viz., "the nation, the law, and the king," is improper. If taken at all, it ought to be as in America, to the nation only. The law may or may not be good; but, in this place, it can have no other meaning, than as being conducive to the happiness of a nation, and therefore is included in it. The remainder of the oath is improper, on the ground, that all personal oaths ought to be abolished. They are the remains of tyranny on one part and slavery on the other; and the name of the Creator ought not to be introduced to witness the degradation of his creation; or if taken, as is already mentioned, as figurative of the nation, it is in this place redundant. But whatever apology may be made for oaths at the first establishment of a government, they ought not to be permitted afterwards. <b>If a government requires the support of oaths, it is a sign that it is not worth supporting, and ought not to be supported. </b>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>The Age of Reason</i>:
</p>
<dl><dd>The Almighty Lecturer, by displaying the principles of science in the structure of the universe, has invited man to study and to imitation. It is as if He had said to the inhabitants of this globe that we call ours, "I have made an earth for man to dwell upon, and I have rendered the starry heavens visible, to teach him science and the arts. He can now provide for his own comfort, and learn from my munificence to all to be kind to each other."
</dd></dl>
<p><i>Agrarian Justice</i>:
</p>
<dl><dd>Instead of preaching to encourage one part of mankind in insolence...it would be better that priests employed their time to render the general condition of man less miserable than it is. Practical religion consists in doing good: and the only way of serving God is that of endeavoring to make His creation happy. All preaching that has not this, for its object is nonsense and hypocrisy.
</dd></dl>
<p><i>Proposal That Louisiana be Purchased</i> (1802):
</p>
<dl><dd>Suppose then the Government begin by making; a proposal to France to repurchase the cession made to her by Spain, of Louisiana, provided it be with the consent of the people of Louisiana, or a majority thereof. 
</dd></dl>
<p><i>Of the Word "Religion"</i>:
</p>
<dl><dd>Books, whether Bibles or Korans, carry no evidence of being the work of any other power than man.
</dd></dl>
