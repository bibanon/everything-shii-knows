<p>The ultimate goals of the teachings of Buddhism are to be proficient in both exoteric and esoteric Buddhism, master all of the Five Vidyas, enlighten oneself and others, and have great compassion as one’s foundation. To be proficient in both exoteric and esoteric Buddhism one must thoroughly understand the Tripitaka (the Buddhist canon) and the esoteric dharma. To master all of the Five Vidyas one must attain penetrating realization in the categories of craftsmanship, sound, healing, causality (logic), and inner realization. Having mastered all Five Vidyas, one has fully enlightened oneself. Only after one has attained enlightenment, can one help to enlighten others. To have great compassion as one’s foundation one must have a mind that has as its basis the benefiting of other people.
</p><p>This is an exhibition of the Five Vidyas, which have been described in the true teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha. It displays some of the individual accomplishments of H.H. Wan Ko Yeshe Norbu, also known as Master Wan Ko Yee. Master Wan Ko Yee has wondrously mastered the Five Vidyas. He has attained remarkable realization in all areas included within the Five Vidyas.
</p><p>The fact that the Master respects the Twenty-One Taras for their great compassion toward living beings has caused him to select twenty-one categories of his achievements as tribute to the holy Taras. It also serves the purpose of beseeching the Twenty-One Taras to bless living beings with good fortune, countries with prosperity and security, and the world with peace. Due to the Master’s high state of realization, his works have transcended worldliness and reached a state of holiness. The mystery of these works will enchant you, and you will find them unbelievable! If you do not personally see such works, which have now appeared in this world for the first time, it might be difficult for you to imagine that this world actually has such inconceivable and mystical creations. For example, with the appearance of Yun sculptures, all splendid pearls, jade, and gemstones become pale in comparison, like the stars in the sky being out shined by a clear moon.
</p><p>H.H. Great Dharma King Master Wan Ko Yeshe Norbu, the creator of these mysterious works, who immigrated to the United States from China, is a great master of outstanding international fame. During the thousands of years of human history, never has anyone person made such magnificent achievements as H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee. In the field of art, he has been a pioneer and has opened a new page in history in areas such as Chinese painting, Western oil painting, representational painting, abstract painting, 3-dimensional painting, the art of applying colors to portray realistic rock texture and rock grains, as well as sculpture, frame art, and calligraphy. He has reached the summit of which others can only dream. He has also reached the pinnacle of world-class achievement in the fields of cosmology, philosophy, science, literature, poetry, etc. These accomplishments are the result of having attained the highest mastery of the Five Vidyas through the prajna wisdom of Buddhism. H.H. Great Dharma King has numerous achievements. However, in order to correspond with the dharma of great compassion of the Taras, this exhibition will only display works in twenty-one categories.
</p><p>As early as 1991, the Master was awarded the title of “Master of Oriental Art.” The representative presenting the award highly praised the Master when he said, “Professor Wan Ko Yee restores the 5,000 year old intrinsic culture of China.” In 1994, the 5,612 experts and scholars representing forty-eight countries and regions at the “World Poets and Culture Congress” unanimously named Master Wan Ko Yee as a “Distinguished International Master.” The certificate was signed and issued by Juan Antonio Samaranch, the then President of the International Olympic Committee.
</p><p>In September of 1999, the Master was conferred a Ph.D. in Buddhism, Philosophy, Art, Calligraphy and Painting by the American League of Colleges and Universities. Moreover, Master Wan Ko Yee is the only artist awarded the position of “Fellow” by the Royal Academy of Arts in the United Kingdom in the Academy’s over two hundred year history.
</p><p>In the beginning of the 21st Century, H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee created “Yun sculpture,” which amazed the world of art. The birth of “Yun sculpture” raised art to an astonishingly new height. During the thousands of years of human civilization, no one else’s sculpture actually surpassed the delicate and wonderful beauty of natural stones. Only Yun sculpture art created by Master Wan Ko Yee surpasses the natural world and its beauty! No precious stone in this world can compare with the beauty, mystery, majesty, and resplendence of Yun sculptures. Inside the Yun sculptures entitled “Boulder With Mist” and “Wonder of a Mysterious Cave,” there are grottoes that contain constantly lingering auspicious mist. For the first time in the history of sculpture, mist has been created through carving skills. It is truly unprecedented! Furthermore, attempts by countless artists have proven that Yun sculptures cannot be replicated! This is a miracle in the history of sculpture!
</p><p>The mystery and matchless beauty of Yun sculpture have shaken the world. The Organization of American States (OAS), composed of 34 countries including the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, sponsored the “Master Wan Ko Yee Yun Sculpture Exhibition” in 2003 at the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C. Ambassadors from various countries who attended that exhibition highly praised H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee as having made a great contribution to art in the world. They marveled at the Yun sculptures they saw, uttering words of admiration such as, “They are enrapturing, unique masterpieces!”
</p><p>On October 28th and 29th, 2003, the U.S. Congress held an art exhibition for the first time in its history. It was called “Exhibition of Yun Sculpture Art Originated by Master Wan Ko Yee for the Benefit of Mankind” and took place at the Gold Room of the Congressional House Office Building. A continuous stream of visitors came to the exhibition. Hundreds of them wrote down their sincere impressions in guest books. The congressmen who attended were so excited that they gave forth spontaneous speeches of praise and admiration. Some people came to the exhibition three or four times in one day. Many people praised the Master’s Yun sculptures as “treasures from heaven”!
</p><p>The Chinese paintings of H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee stand on the summit of the history of that genre of painting. Whether Western or Eastern, no artist in history is comparable to Master Yee. He is able to paint landscapes, flowers, birds, fish, insects, animals, and human figures as well as intriguing abstract compositions. His techniques include heavy coloring, light touch, fine and detailed brushwork, freehand brushwork, large format composition, splash-ink, oil painting, glass painting, 3-dimensional painting, and imitation jade painting. He has reached the highest level in all of these areas. The Master has learned from the strong points of both ancient and modern masters of Chinese and Western painting, merging what he has learned to create transcendent artwork. He has formed his own style, which has reached the acme of perfection and naturalness in both technique and artistic conception. They mark the apex of the history of painting.
</p><p>The original paintings of the Master entitled “Majesty” and “Venerable Da Li Wang” were sold for US$2,125,327and US$2,207,912, respectively, at international auctions. They not only became the highest priced paintings by any living artist in the Pacific region and Southeast Asia, but also broke the records for the highest priced Chinese paintings sold through auction.
</p><p>H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee is also an outstanding man of letters. He has composed a great amount of poetry using the classical Chinese forms of shi, ci, ge and fu. He has also written many books and discourses. His writing style is elegant and classical, varying and evolving without limit. When read aloud in Chinese, his written words sound melodic, like gold knocking on jade, and when chanted flow naturally and smoothly, like floating clouds or a running stream.
</p><p>The Master’s calligraphy has transcended all traces of worldliness. His calligraphic style is elevated and expresses a broad perspective. The work coming from his brush can change from dragons crawling on cliffs to the play of innocent children. There is wonder in even the mundane strokes.His calligraphy is naturally graceful, exhibiting depth and brilliance. All Chinese people know of the great calligrapher Xi-Zhi Wang. They know of Shao-Ji He and Huai-Guan Zhang, who excelled at the rapid, cursive style of writing. There was also Yue Fei. In modern times, there have been Shu-Tong Li and You-Ren Yu, who can be called the finest calligraphers. However, the Master’s calligraphic style incorporates the strengths of all of the various schools and has reached the level of consummate skill. After one has personally viewed the Master’s calligraphy and compared the Master’s calligraphy to the calligraphy of those great calligraphers just mentioned, one will know who sets the example for others!
</p><p>Employing his superlative oil painting artistry, the Master has created “supernatural abstract colors.” He has thereby again opened up a new world of art that is beautiful, mysterious, and soul-inspiring! You will find the bright and dazzling colors leaping and dancing, vigorous like towering waves surging over thousands of miles, yet stored up into wonders at the fine tip of a brush. They freely transcend worldliness. Various colors are mixed ingeniously and beautifully, distilling beauty from their mutual nourishment. Their many forms and meanings are like a golden dragon breaking away from the earth’s crust and soaring in the azure sky above the blue sea, free at will, unbridled and unrestrained, all worldly dust whisked away, ever changing, and beautiful beyond compare! This form of art most embodies the essence of Western abstract painting.
</p><p>The frames and jade-like plates created by H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee can be described as “embodying the essence of Nature yet surpassing the craftsmanship of Nature.” The frames of the Master cannot be limited to the concept of frames.They also are a particular kind of extremely exquisite and precious art. They vividly reproduce the superlative craftsmanship seen in the creation of everything in Nature yet embody what is refined rather than coarse, amplifying the ephemeral or unostentatious beauty of precious natural beings in life to the perfect zenith of art.
</p><p>The Master uses his painting brush to create imitation jade-plates, which are unique and amazing treasures in the history of mankind. The Master’s Fei-Cui jade, Yang-Zhi jade, Shan-Hong jade, Li-He jade, Fu-Shou jade, Tai-Hu jade, Hai-Jiao jade, Gang-Gu jade,etc. all look real and vivid in their textures, luster, colors, patterns, grains, and shapes. Those who have seen the imitation jades at the exhibition all agreed that their authenticity and beauty surpasses those of natural jades. They are so far superior in their exquisite, flawless and gorgeous beauty that the natural treasures cannot be their equal. Every piece is the most revered art of the highest caliber. They manifest a level of artistry that people have always been yearning for yet could not attain in the history of art!
</p><p>The appearance of the Master’s uniquely beautiful, unfathomably mysterious, and holy works of art have shattered mankind’s long-held understanding of artistic creations. Such works of art have opened up a new and miraculous page in the history of aesthetics! Master Yee has thereby brought artistic happiness to mankind. The astonishing beauty of his artistic creations stirs our souls. However, we are not surprised that they resulted from the sculpting and painting skills of the Master. That is because we deeply understand that H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee’s prajna wisdom and artistic talent are as vast and infinite as the open sea. His mysterious artistic masterpieces are just one of the natural crystallizations of his various astonishing talents and the natural outflow of his limitless Buddha-dharma wisdom.
</p><p>The Master is a Great Dharma King of Buddhism. It is difficult to find another person in this world who has succeeded in gaining the high state of virtue and realization that the Master has attained. Many world-renowned monastics, virtuous laypersons, and Buddhist leaders of different sects have formally acknowledged him as their master. During May of 2000, an international Buddhist assembly was held entitled “Symposium to Distinguish Correct and Erroneous Buddhism, Buddhist Studies, and Buddha-Dharma.” That assembly was attended by more than 2,000 eminent monastics and virtuous people representing 28 countries and regions and 416 temples and Buddhist organizations. After long investigation and discussion, the attendees unanimously selected H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee as “the world’s only authentic Buddhist Master”!
</p><p>It is precisely due to his unfathomable Buddha-dharma realization that the Master has acquired erudition and penetrating understanding of the laws that govern the growth and change of everything in the universe. He has thereby attained the highest achievements in various fields, such as religion, literature, philosophy, vocal performances, painting, calligraphy, sculpture, application of colors to portray realistic rock texture and rock grains, medicine, and science. No one in history can match such achievements! The Master truly deserves to be called a great master the likes of which have never been seen in history! Because of this, today we can stroll in this inexhaustibly profound, rare, and beautiful world of art and enjoy one after another ingenious work that retains Nature’s spirit and form but transcends its superlative craftsmanship.
</p><p>We are also very pleased to announce that building material based upon some of H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee’s original mysterious artwork has been produced. There are different kinds of exquisitely beautiful floor and wall decorative material. Such decorative material far excels that found in famous and luxurious palaces. Decorative material in the Louvre Museum in Paris and the luxury hotels in Las Vegas cannot hold a candle to the Master’s decorative material. Eventually, the Master’s floor and wall decorative material will raise the level of aesthetics to a degree difficult to imagine, will cause the quality of life to reach new heights, and will cause heavenly beauty to constantly permeate people’s daily lives all over the world! Surrounded by such extraordinary and precious art, we will feel as if we were in a heavenly paradise.
</p><p>H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee is a figure with magnificent accomplishments in all areas. In all of human history, no one can compare. His high level of virtue and state of realization is difficult to find in the earthly world. Since Master Wan Ko Yee’s status is that of a Dharma King of Buddhism, this exhibition will include Buddha-dharma material for those with sincerity and devotion to study for self-cultivation. It will cause them to obtain good fortune, wisdom, auspiciousness, and liberation. However, this exhibition does not include the Master’s accomplishments in medicine,science, etc. Therefore, only a small part of his achievements will be displayed. These are the most extraordinary achievements in the history of Buddhism, art and literature. The exhibition features 1. designs of the Buddhas’ images,2. poetry, 3. ancient literature, 4. modern literature, 5. couplets, 6. philosophical sayings, 7. calligraphy, 8. bronze and stone inscriptions, 9. Chinese paintings, 10. western paintings, 11. decorative wall hangings, 12. jade plates, 13. tiles, 14. glass paintings, 15. three-dimensional paintings, 16. art frames, 17. famous teas, 18. health care products, 19. Yun sculptures, 20. vocal performances, and 21. supreme and profound Buddha-dharma that is difficult to encounter in millions of eons. There are more than 200 pieces of world-class high achievements.They represent the Master’s extensive knowledge and talents. Under each category of the displayed pieces various styles will be exhibited.The works included in this exhibition have reached the pinnacle of art in all twenty-one categories.
</p><p>Under the category of Yun Sculpture, there are wondrous multicolored sculptures, mist sculptures, aged and desiccated vine sculptures, tropical vine sculptures, rock mountain sculptures, imitation jade sculptures, blossom tree sculptures, coral sculptures, ganoderma sculptures, animal skin sculptures, etc. representing completely different techniques. This exhibition will feature the following Yun sculptures: “A Majestic and Splendid Stone Suggestive of Poetry, Song, and Painting,”“Mysterious Boulder With Mist,” “An Ancient Castle With Entwined Vines,” etc.The mist sculptures are the one and only art of mankind that creates mist through carving. The wondrous multicolored sculptures are art that have appeared among mankind and are so beautiful, they resemble treasures in heaven. As some experts exclaimed, their beauty surpasses the beauty of human art and captures the human soul. There is no one in history who has individually achieved the outstanding levels of accomplishments in so many categories. Moreover, there are numerous items of Master’s accomplishments not being displayed in this event. Therefore, it really proves that H.H. Master Wan Ko Yee’s accomplishments in all areas are astonishing and unprecedented in human history.
</p><p>What has caused these accomplishments? In short, it is the Buddha-dharma that has caused the accomplishments. The Master is a true Great Dharma King of Buddhism with the mastery of Five Vidyas. He has loving kindness and great compassion. He is selfless and free of attachments. He takes in the sufferings of the living beings in the six realms as his own. He only feels blessed when others receive good fortune. He equally praises all traditional religions including Christianity. The Master constantly teaches living beings how to persistently plant all good causes, and to stay away from evil, fear and obstacles. He prays for the safety and happiness of people, the prosperity of countries, and the peace of the world.

<p><i>The United Relief Committee has been established as a permanent organization as proposed by Master Wan Ko Yee to raise funds for international disaster relief. The United International World Buddhism Association Headquarters in San Francisco, California started such a fund to provide assistance to those impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Master Wan Ko Yee and his family made the first donation, offering $1.2 million in stock to the fund.</i>
</p><p>Monterey Park, CA, (PRWEB) September 16, 2005 -- In order to provide those affected by Hurricane Katrina with immediate relief, the United Relief Committee has been established as proposed by Master Wan Ko Yee, the Honorable Chairman of United International World Buddhism Association Headquarters (U.I.W.B.A.H.) and a world renown master of art. The U.I.W.B.A.H. has initiated the effort of establishing such a committee at its Southern California Chapter. Master Wan Ko Yee stated, “Hurricane Katrina has destroyed houses, submerged cities and displaced hundreds of thousands of people from their communities. The federal and state governments have been doing their utmost in the relief and recovery efforts, but the affected areas are so enormous and the victims are so numerous. We cannot simply watch the government act. We ourselves are obligated to help the disaster victims. This is a critical moment for us to promptly offer as much of our help as possible. We feel their pain and suffering. We will not only donate money and supplies, but also do everything in our power to gather as many people as possible to join us in the relief effort in order to alleviate the victims’ suffering and assist them in reconstructing their homes...”
</p><p>Right after his speech, Master Wan Ko Yee, on behalf of his family, donated 4,950,000 of his shares of a prestigious art company, Superior Art Frame Company Limited (valued at US$1,200,000.00) to the United Relief Committee. Master Wan Ko Yee’s wife, Mrs. Yuhua Wang, also said, “The victims in the affected areas are devastated and in great need of help. We want to do our best in our relief effort…”
</p><p>The abbess of Hua Zang Si, Dharma Master Long-Hui addressed the attendees, “I would like to shortly express my opinions. As the CEO of the United Relief Committee and the abbess of a Buddhist temple, and based on my personal understanding on the family situation of Master Wan Ko Yee, I feel obligated to honestly say what I have in mind. As a matter of fact, all the family members of Master Wan Ko Yee are involved in art work. They sell their art work to support themselves. Master Wan Ko Yee’s family is currently under great financial pressure and is short on funds since they have been helping a lot of people, including monastics and laypersons, financially for many years. There has been a great number of such cases that I’m aware of. Nevertheless, Master’s family spares no effort in making contribution for the victims in the affected areas.”
</p><p>On the same day that Master Wan Ko Yee proposed establishing this relief effort, many Buddhist congregations, non-Buddhist organizations and individuals expressed their support of Master Wan Ko Yee’s advocacy by joining the United Relief Committee. Included in this effort to date are thirty-nine organizations from all over the world. The number is still increasing at this moment.
</p><p>There are hundreds of thousands of displaced fellow Americans in urgent need of our help. All of the relief fund raised by the United Relief Committee will be sent to affected areas through
the Katrina fund established by former President Bush and former President Clinton. The United Relief Committee urges those of you who would like to offer help to join the committee and urge others to donate. With the expansion of the United Relief Committee, chapters will be established around the world.
</p><p>The United Relief Committee is a continuous worldwide charity relief organization based in the United States. It is operated within the laws and regulations of the United States. It accepts legal charitable contributions of groups or individuals from all over the world. It offers relief aid to communities or individuals affected by natural or other disasters.

<p>The painting "Two Flowers; One Lotus Cupule; One Dharma Nature (Lotus)" , one of the three Chinese paintings displayed, was sold at USD$300,000.- per sq. ft yesterday at Hua Zang Si temple in San Francisco, where a painting auction was held.
</p><p>According to Hua Zang Si, the world renowned Great Dharma King Yangwo Wan Ko Yeshe Norbu in Buddhism, who is also known as Master Wan Ko Yee, a magnificent artist, donated three masterpiece paintings to International Buddhism Sangha Association. At the public auction event held by International Buddhism Sangha Association, there were approximately more than 10 people interested in purchasing the three paintings. After several rounds of biddings, a Caucasian collector, Ian Hamilton from England won the bid at bid price of USD$300,000.- per sq. ft for “Two Flowers; One Lotus Cupule; One Dharma Nature (Lotus)". Another painting, “Plum Blossoms” was sold for USD$210,000.- per sq. ft. Nevertheless, the highly praised painting before the event, "Pasture In Spring (a shepherd boy pasturing cattle)”was not sold. Some experts have considered "Pasture In Spring (a shepherd boy pasturing cattle)" as the masterpiece among all work of art. Even though a bidder once raised his offer to USD$540,000.- per sq. ft., the auctioneer insisted that all bids cannot be lower than the reserve price of USD$ 900,000.- per sq. ft. Due to the huge gap between the reserve price and the bid, the painting was not sold.

<p>Mystic, wondrous, noble, and enchanting!
</p><p>A mysterious art which is recognized as a precious treasure from heaven appears in the world for the first time!
</p><p>On February 5-27, 2006, the Master Wan Ko Yee International Cultural Institute will hold an exhibition of the World-Class Treasures created by Master Wan Ko Yee (Dharma King Wan Ko Yeshe Norbu). Regarded by all as enchanting and precious treasures from another dimension, this art appears in the world for the first time. The Organization of American States, which represents 34 countries, sponsored a special exhibition of Master Wan Ko Yee’s work for ambassadors and dignitaries. Now you can see this mysterious and wondrous art. It is praised as “Treasures from Heaven.” This exhibit displays superb, extraordinary art, profound knowledge, holy virtue, and more from another realm. Admission is free.
</p><p>San Francisco, California, February 3, 2006 - A rare exhibit of Master Wan Ko Yee’s world-class art, literary accomplishments, and innovations will be held from February 5 through 27, 2006 at 1822 Eddy Street, San Francisco, California.
</p><p>The exhibition will showcase more than 200 pieces of the Master’s artwork in 18 categories. This represents only a small portion of Master Wan Ko Yee’s outstanding accomplishments. The exhibition features Yun sculptures, Chinese paintings, western paintings, art frames, jade plates, three-dimensional pictures, calligraphy, poetry, and literature, along with the latest application of the master’s designs in ceramic, enamel, glass, and other mediums for use in beautifying the domestic and work environment. These tiles, wall hangings, transparent panels, etc. are unbelievably beautiful and highly original, surpassing the elegance of materials found in the Louvre Museum in Paris or the luxury hotels of Las Vegas. These are suitable for the most elegant homes, up-scale restaurants, fashionable hotels, sophisticated offices, or other places to create a noble and enhanced quality of life. Master Yee wants to make his enlightened view of a world of incredible beauty available to everyone.
</p><p>Master Wan Ko Yee, who currently resides in the United States, is known as Dharma King Wan Ko Yeshe Norbu. Over 2,000 Buddhist leaders from thirty-three  countries and 416 organizations, recognized Master Yee as a Dharma King and “Authentic Buddhism Master.” It is difficult to find another person in this world who has succeeded in gaining the high state of virtue and realization that Master Yee has attained. It is precisely due to his unfathomable Buddha-dharma realization that the Master has acquired erudition and penetrating understanding of the laws that govern the growth and change of everything in the universe. He has thereby attained the highest achievements in various fields, such as religion, literature, philosophy, painting, calligraphy, sculpture, and application of color. No one in history can match such achievements. 
</p><p>He is a master of art of outstanding international fame. The Chinese paintings of Master Wan Ko Yee were sold at auctions at the highest prices for paintings by any living artist in Southeast Asia, going for over two million US dollars each. With the appearance of Yun Sculpture, created by the Master for humanity, all splendid pearls, jades, and gemstones become pale in comparison, like the stars in the sky being outshined by a clear moon.  The Yun sculpture created by the Master is an art with indescribable beauty and appears in the world for the first time. Its beauty surpasses that of any natural pearls, jades or precious gemstones. No precious stone in this world can compare with the mystery and resplendence of Yun sculptures. Some of you might consider this an overstatement, but when you see the beautiful and wondrous artwork, you will be surprised, enchanted, and see that this is not an exaggeration.
</p><p>The Organization of American States, which represents 34 countries, sponsored a special exhibition featuring part of Master Wan Ko Yee’s work for ambassadors and dignitaries. The artwork was recognized by all as a precious treasure from heaven. The Master is also the only artist awarded the position of “Fellow” by the Royal Academy of Arts in the London in the Academy’s over two hundred year history.  As you can see, this is not an ordinary artist, nor is this an ordinary exhibition.
</p><p>The frames and jade-like plates created by Master Wan Ko Yee can be described as “embodying the essence of Nature yet surpassing the craftsmanship of Nature.” The frames of the Master cannot be limited to the concept of frames.They also are a particular kind of extremely exquisite and precious art. They vividly reproduce the superlative craftsmanship seen in the creation of everything in Nature yet embody what is refined rather than coarse, amplifying the ephemeral or unostentatious beauty of precious natural beings in life to the perfect zenith of art.
</p><p>The appearance of Master Yee’s uniquely beautiful, unfathomably mysterious, and holy works of art have shattered mankind’s long-held understanding of artistic creations. The astonishing beauty of his artistic creations stirs ones soul.  His mysterious artistic masterpieces are the natural crystallization of his various astonishing talents, the natural outflow of his limitless Buddha-dharma wisdom and compassion. They also represent his very high moral achievement and the highest expression of kindness, generosity, and selflessness. It is the Master’s compassionate desire that everyone be able to attain this level as well.  What you see in this exhibit is superb extraordinary art, profound knowledge, holy virtue, and more, truly from another realm.
</p><p>The exhibition is free to the public.

</p>
<pre>这么多年来在国内一些佛教论坛上有关义云高的争议总是没有停止，有些论坛索性把义云高大师列为“附佛外道”，“骗子”等，“附佛外道”的依据是义云高大师被公安的通辑和四川媒体所报导的《四川“密宗大师”义云高诈骗2.7亿元案始末》，多年来翻来覆去就是这两样被某些人认为强有力的“依据”。他们既有意回避海外媒体对义云高的正面报导，也有意忽略国内权威媒体报导。好好看看这些报道吧。<a href="http://www.people.com.cn/item/flg/home.html" class="external free" title="http://www.people.com.cn/item/flg/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.people.com.cn/item/flg/home.html</a>

我们不妨思考一个问题， 28个国家佛教团体2000多高僧参加的“世界佛教、佛学、佛法正邪研讨会”，会评审一个“附佛外道”，一个骗子为“真正名符其实的大法王”吗？如果做肯定回答，那只能说明那些参会的佛教团体和高僧也是“附佛外道”了，其中包括，世界僧伽协会主席悟明长老；国际僧尼佛教总会主席陈慧导师；全球唯一的汉人藏密格西、美国密宗总会主席洛桑珍珠活佛及国际佛教会主席伏藏罗布大师等大师。这可是犯了谤佛谤法谤僧的罪业了。 
暂且不说其它知名大师，就全球唯一的汉人藏密格西、美国密宗总会主席洛桑珍珠活佛来说，他在汉藏两地佛界中的地位都非泛泛。就汉地佛界而言，他曾担任过中国近代佛学泰斗太虚法师的私人秘书，与汉地佛界的上层过往甚密，而在雪域求法的最显著成就则是获得了藏传佛教的最高学位———西藏三大寺的拉然巴格西。中国佛教协会副会长，厦门南普陀寺方丈圣辉法师2004年3月19日领团赴美参加海峡两岸佛教音乐展演期间还专门拜访洛桑珍珠（<a href="http://news.163.com/2004w03/12497/2004w03_1079780057046.html），洛桑珍珠活佛在他所译《菩提道次第略论》的序言中也详细描述了他亲眼所见的义云高大师的佛法证量（http://www.worlddharmavoice.com/GeXie_2prelude.htm），他曾对媒体记者感慨地说“我学佛60年还不如跟大师学一天”" class="external free" title="http://news.163.com/2004w03/12497/2004w03_1079780057046.html），洛桑珍珠活佛在他所译《菩提道次第略论》的序言中也详细描述了他亲眼所见的义云高大师的佛法证量（http://www.worlddharmavoice.com/GeXie_2prelude.htm），他曾对媒体记者感慨地说“我学佛60年还不如跟大师学一天”" rel="nofollow">http://news.163.com/2004w03/12497/2004w03_1079780057046.html），洛桑珍珠活佛在他所译《菩提道次第略论》的序言中也详细描述了他亲眼所见的义云高大师的佛法证量（http://www.worlddharmavoice.com/GeXie_2prelude.htm），他曾对媒体记者感慨地说“我学佛60年还不如跟大师学一天”</a> 
成都昭觉寺住持，1999年6月圆寂的中国著名得道高僧清定法师于1992年7月15日曾为义云高大师所著的《般若波罗密多心经讲义》写序，老法师在序中写道“有幸拜读无名行者（云高大师)所著的般若波罗密多心经讲义 ，真是大开智慧之门 ，这部讲义实在是堪称耀古腾今 ，慧光无瑕 ，前无古德可及 。 ……因无名行者实非普通大德 ，号称无名 ，实乃大名鼎鼎一代大师 ，为当今妙谙五明 、显密俱通的法界巨德 。”（<a href="http://www.worlddharmavoice.com/master_bar.htm）。" class="external free" title="http://www.worlddharmavoice.com/master_bar.htm）。" rel="nofollow">http://www.worlddharmavoice.com/master_bar.htm）。</a> 
我们不妨再思考一个问题，门下弟子上百万之众，以修大威德金刚而成就的格鲁巴汉人巨德——清定法师难道会为一个“附佛外道”， 一个“骗子”所著的书去写序？除非清定法师也是“附佛外道”或无视众生慧命？这是在严重诽谤清定老法师呀！ 
此外，多杰羌佛三世——《正法宝典》（<a href="http://www.sunmoonlight.org/book.htm）中登载了百多位当今世界第一流著名的佛教领袖古德大圣佛菩萨们，是各大宗派的领袖和摄政大仁波且，转世的大圣德们，共同认证附议祝贺云高益西诺布顶圣如来为原始报身佛多杰羌佛的原始档.如：萨迦派总教主天津大乘法王、龙钦宁体总法主第四世多珠钦法王、宁玛派第三任总法王贝诺法王、宁玛派降养龙多加参遍智法王、觉囊派总教主吉美多杰法王、宁玛派北藏传承达龙哲珠法王等等。" class="external free" title="http://www.sunmoonlight.org/book.htm）中登载了百多位当今世界第一流著名的佛教领袖古德大圣佛菩萨们，是各大宗派的领袖和摄政大仁波且，转世的大圣德们，共同认证附议祝贺云高益西诺布顶圣如来为原始报身佛多杰羌佛的原始档.如：萨迦派总教主天津大乘法王、龙钦宁体总法主第四世多珠钦法王、宁玛派第三任总法王贝诺法王、宁玛派降养龙多加参遍智法王、觉囊派总教主吉美多杰法王、宁玛派北藏传承达龙哲珠法王等等。" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunmoonlight.org/book.htm）中登载了百多位当今世界第一流著名的佛教领袖古德大圣佛菩萨们，是各大宗派的领袖和摄政大仁波且，转世的大圣德们，共同认证附议祝贺云高益西诺布顶圣如来为原始报身佛多杰羌佛的原始档.如：萨迦派总教主天津大乘法王、龙钦宁体总法主第四世多珠钦法王、宁玛派第三任总法王贝诺法王、宁玛派降养龙多加参遍智法王、觉囊派总教主吉美多杰法王、宁玛派北藏传承达龙哲珠法王等等。</a> 
</p>
<pre>我们不妨再思考第三个问题，如果这么多权威的认证附议祝贺都不能成立的话，那从古至今还有哪个转世仁波切、法王的身分是真的，甚至连佛教佛法佛学都可以认定为虚假。因为法王仁波切们是佛教中高层圣者，如果佛教徒连高层圣者的认证附议祝贺都不承认，不就否定了佛教的存在吗？我们能否定达赖喇嘛、萨迦天津、噶玛巴不是真的活佛转世吗？难道他们是假的吗？要知道，他们是经过具认证权的摄政王仁波切们所认证的，难道认证他们的摄政王仁波切们是写假认证书，是说假话骗众生吗？ 
</pre>
<p>也有人在没有向相关法王仁波切求证的情况下，仅凭自己的臆测就不负责任的说“那些认证附议祝贺是造假”，但奇怪的是，《正法宝典》所列的这些法王、仁波切几乎都在世，为何他们没有站出来揭发这种“欺世盗名，公然造假，诓骗众生”的恶劣行径？为何他们会无视众生慧命，眼睁睁看着众生受骗呢？只有一个答案，那就是他们确确实实有认证附议祝贺过云高益西诺布顶圣如来为原始报身佛多杰羌佛。
