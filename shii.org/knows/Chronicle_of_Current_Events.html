<div id='article'><p>The <b>Chronicle of Current Events</b>, i.e. Хроника текущих событий, was a major Russian <i>samizdat</i> (self-published) news bulletin. It was founded during the International Human Rights Year, 1968, with the purpose of reporting on the state of human rights in the Soviet Union, and somehow managed to keep publishing until 1983. From the very first issue its editorial policy was to simply report facts. For example, reporting on the trial of Galanskov, Ginzburg, Dobrovolsky, and Lashovka:
</p>
<dl><dd>All four were charged under article 70 of the criminal code, and Galanskov was additionally charged under article 88-1. All four were arrested in January 1967 and had spent nearly a year in Lefortovo prison, in violation of article 97 of the Russian criminal code, according to which the maximum period of pretrial detention may not exceed nine months.
</dd></dl>
<p>The Soviet Union in 1968 claimed to be a champion of human rights and free speech, so the <i>Chronicle</i> in turn asserted itself to be simply reporting facts and operating in a wholly legal way. The reality, of course, was that the <i>Chronicle</i> was published in a country in which the truth itself was something which the government wished to control. The government found the <i>Chronicle</i> horribly inconvenient, and the KGB sent most of those associated with it to extended interrogations and, eventually, labor camps and exile.

<a name="How_the_Chronicle_worked" id="How_the_Chronicle_worked"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">How the Chronicle worked</span></h2>
<p>The Chronicle was originally compiled by Natalya Gorbanevskaya. Gorbanevskaya would type up the inconvenient truths she received from her friends in Moscow on a typewriter purchased on the gray market. All work had to be done covertly, although the Chronicle would always insist on its legality, because the KGB was attempting to monitor the Russian human rights movement. Gorbanevskaya typed each issue of the Chronicle six times, access to photocopiers being controlled by the Soviet Union. These copies would be secretly distributed to friends, who made copies on their own typewriters and gave these to friends, etc.
</p><p>The KGB broke into Gorbanevskaya's home on December 24, 1969 as she was compiling issue #11. She hid her source papers, which had handwriting which could identify other authors, in her desk, and additional information was hidden in her coat. By a stroke of luck the KGB managed to miss both of these hiding places, and #11 was released on schedule, headlined with a story on Gorbanevskaya's arrest. She was diagnosed as schizophrenic and threatened with confinement in a mental hospital, but eventually allowed to return to Moscow and emigrate to Paris.
</p>
<a name="Case_24" id="Case_24"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Case 24</span></h2>
<p>After two years, the Chronicle was finally in the KGB's spotlight. From 1970 to 1972 the Chronicle was "Case 24" in their broader efforts to squash dissent, leading to the arrests of many associated with it.
</p><p>Anatoly Yakobson took up the reins of the Chronicle after Gorbanevskaya's arrest. He faithfully continued the detached and factual style of reporting, separating rumors from reliable information. 
</p>
<a name="Other_arrests" id="Other_arrests"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other arrests</span></h2>
<ul><li> Kronid Lyubarsky, astronomer and part of the pyramid of <i>Chronicle</i> reproducers. Tried in October 1972. Argued that the <i>Chronicle</i> contained no biased statements or propaganda. Convicted anyway.
</li><li> Victor Khaustov. Arrested in January 1972. Tried in March 1974 (once again, in violation of Soviet law code). Sentenced to four years in labor camps and two years internal exile.
</li><li> Alexander Bolonkin and Valery Balakirev. Arrested in September 1972. Tried together in November 1973. Balakirev plea bargained and received five years in prison. Bolonkin was sentenced to four years in labor camps and two years internal exile.
</li><li> George Davydov. Arrested in September 1972. Tried in July 1973. Balakirev testified that Davydov gave him articles to pass on to the Chronicle. Sentenced to five years in a "strict, corrective" labor camp and two years in exile.
</li><li> Yuri Shikahnovich, Moscow University mathematics professor. Arrested in September 1972. Tried in November 1973. Sent to a "mental hospital".
</li><li> Gabriel Superfin. Arrested in July 1973. Tried in May 1974. Was found to have made annotations and corrections to a draft of Peter Reddaway's book <i>Uncensored Russia</i>, a translation of the Chronicle, as well as distributing the Chronicle itself. Sentenced to five years in labor camps and two years in internal exile.
</li><li> Pyotr Yakir and Victor Krasin, two dissidents who confessed their connections and a large number of names. Arrested in September 1972. Tried August 27 - September 1, 1973. KGB Major Pavel Alexandrovsky used 12-hour psychological interrogations on Krasin for seven days a week, alternately pleading with him and threatening him. Krasin's cell mate, a KGB plant, also persuaded him to cooperate. Yakir was likely subjected to the same techniques; he later told his daughter Irina that he believed the Chronicle distributed inaccurate and dangerous information. Their show trial was believed by many foreign assistants to be the end of the <i>Chronicle</i>, but it was revived under greater secrecy.
</li><li> Sergei Pirogov. Arrested in July 1973. Tried in May 1974. Judge used the ruling in the Yakir-Krasin case to establish that the <i>Chronicle</i> was anti-Soviet and charged Pirogov under article 190-1 of the criminal code. Sentenced to two years in a labor camp.
</li><li> Lev Ladyzhensky and Fyodor Korovin. Arrested in December 1973. Tried in September-October 1974. Both plea bargained, claiming they were influenced by anti-Soviet radio broadcasts. Ladyzhensky received three years in labor camps and three years in exile. Korovin received two years in both.
</li><li> Sergei Kovalev, internationally renowned biologist. Arrested in December 1974. Sentenced to seven years in labor camps and three years in internal exile.
</li><li> Tatyana Velikanova. Arrested in 1979. Sentenced to four years in labor camps and five years internal exile in Kazakhstan. 
</li><li> Alexander Lavut
</li><li> Irina Yakir, Pyotr Yakir's daughter. 
</li><li> Yuri Gastev. Forced to emigrate in 1981.
