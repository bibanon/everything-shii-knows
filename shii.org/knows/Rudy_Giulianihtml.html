<div id='article'><p>Here are some things that <b>Rudy Giuliani</b> did.
</p><p>October 1993: "Rudolph W. Giuliani asserted yesterday that a prominent black minister's charge that he is supported by 'fascist elements' seemed intended as an anti-Italian slur and may have been part of a coordinated effort by the Dinkins campaign to use supporters to inject race into the campaign." [Dinkins is black] <a href="http://snurl.com/1r3k7" class="external free" title="http://snurl.com/1r3k7" rel="nofollow">http://snurl.com/1r3k7</a>
</p><p>March 1994: Giuliani defines freedom: "We look upon authority too often and focus over and over again, for 30 or 40 or 50 years, as if there is something wrong with authority. ... Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do... You have free speech so I can be heard." <a href="http://snurl.com/1r3k6" class="external free" title="http://snurl.com/1r3k6" rel="nofollow">http://snurl.com/1r3k6</a>
</p><p>1994: Giuliani's Street Crimes unit is dispatched to frisk random New Yorkers on the street for illegal weapons. Tens of thousands of searches are done without warrant. [Times Union, Apr 2, 1999]
</p><p>1995: "'NO DANCING,' reads the sign behind the bar. It’s not some kitschy 19th-century relic. It’s the law in New York City, as revived by our just-departed mayor, Rudy Giuliani.  ... A 1995 law makes it a misdemeanor for 20 or more people to be in a park without a permit--so far, it’s only been used against witches, rappers, and Lower East Side squatters." <a href="http://www.tenant.net/tengroup/Metcounc/Jan02/giuliani.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tenant.net/tengroup/Metcounc/Jan02/giuliani.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tenant.net/tengroup/Metcounc/Jan02/giuliani.html</a>
</p><p>August 1997: Giuliani arrests a whistleblowing reporter on a 13-year-old traffic warrant. When a judge throws out the case Giuliani's spokeswoman accuses the whistleblower of sodomy. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/us/politics/22giuliani.html?hp" class="external free" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/us/politics/22giuliani.html?hp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/us/politics/22giuliani.html?hp</a>
</p><p>1997: Giuliani pressured the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to pull an advertisement from city buses which lightly criticized him, even though there was no legal basis for it. The ad claimed New York magazine was "possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't taken credit for." <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/news/1997/1215n.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rcfp.org/news/1997/1215n.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/news/1997/1215n.html</a>
</p><p>1998: "He also resented the intrusion of the two other major checks on his power: the Independent Budget Office, an independent financial watchdog created in 1989 as a counterweight to the mayor's enhanced authority; and the Office of the Public Advocate, which acts as an ombudsman for the city's residents. Giuliani tried to reduce the public advocate's budget, and refused to fund the IBO until 1996. ... [A new commission] was advised by attorneys from Giuliani's Law Department and usually met in secret. One of the first things it considered was a proposal dear to the mayor: abolishing the Independent Budget Office and the Office of the Public Advocate." <a href="http://www2.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0711.morris.html" class="external free" title="http://www2.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0711.morris.html" rel="nofollow">http://www2.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0711.morris.html</a>
</p><p>1998: "When black supremacist Khalid Muhammad held a march in Harlem in 1998, Giuliani cut off subway service to the neighborhood." <a href="http://www.tenant.net/tengroup/Metcounc/Jan02/giuliani.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tenant.net/tengroup/Metcounc/Jan02/giuliani.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tenant.net/tengroup/Metcounc/Jan02/giuliani.html</a>
</p><p>October 1998: Giuliani secretly installs cameras inside lampposts throughout New York. [Village Voice Oct 6, 1998]
</p><p>February 1999: Giuliani allows cops to automatically seize the cars of anyone they claim was DUI, without a trial. [The Sunday Patriot, Mar 7, 1999] <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/rwg/html/99a/me990404.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/rwg/html/99a/me990404.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/rwg/html/99a/me990404.html</a>
</p><p>1999: "Giuliani shored up control of the police department," after firing a commissioner who appeared on the cover of Time magazine, "by appointing crony Howard Safir... Safir then enhanced the department’s Street Crimes Unit ... [giving them] 'We Own the Night' t-shirts, and shirts citing Ernest Hemingway’s 'There is no hunting like the hunting of man' quote—quite a variation from standard issue uniforms ... [Giuliani's] police unit that became notorious for shooting African immigrant Amadou Diallo 40 times as he reached for his wallet after being ordered to show identification. When New Yorkers took to the streets to protest the shooting, Giuliani told the press that people were protesting due to 'their own personal inadequacies.'" <a href="http://artvoice.com/issues/v6n25/giuliani_altar_boys_and_weasels" class="external free" title="http://artvoice.com/issues/v6n25/giuliani_altar_boys_and_weasels" rel="nofollow">http://artvoice.com/issues/v6n25/giuliani_altar_boys_and_weasels</a>
</p><p>1999: "Especially since his decisive re-election in 1997, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani views freedom of expression as a special threat to his administration. He has stifled speech and press to so unprecedented a degree, and in so many and varied forms, that simply keeping up with the city’s censorious activity has proved a challenge for defenders of free expression." Examples include barring his employees from talking to reporters without his permission, and terminating franchises of newsstands that carried certain newspapers. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2aa9vw" class="external free" title="http://tinyurl.com/2aa9vw" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2aa9vw</a>
</p><p>June 2001: The president of a local union, to much applause, asks Giuliani about a specific payola deal on city bus lines, beginning to explain why he believes there is corruption in the mayor's office. Giuliani calls him and the other New York union members "a bunch of idiots ... morons" and cuts off his mic, saying, "It's really scary that these people drive buses." Giuliani does not let him finish his question despite the dozens of union members in atttendance, and gets armed policemen to drag him from the room. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkhPwlPiHyY" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkhPwlPiHyY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkhPwlPiHyY</a>
</p><p>September 2001: "Mr. Giuliani, as Mr. Green recalled, was blunt: I want to remain in office three more months. I have a great team, I can lobby Washington. I’m being reasonable, he cautioned; my supporters want me to run for a new term ... Mr. Giuliani warmed to the task, jabbing at potential rivals as disaster neophytes. " <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2g38ue" class="external free" title="http://tinyurl.com/2g38ue" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2g38ue</a>
</p><p>November 2001: "The message the city is sending is that if you don't agree with what a union says, you simply arrest its president," Tom Butler, Mr. Gallagher's spokesman, said..."The mayor fails to realize that New York City is not a dictatorship, where if you don't like what a union is doing you can just go and lock up a union's president," the firefighters' union said. "The message being sent from City Hall is that if you don't agree with this administration, we will get you." Captain Gorman, a firefighter for 28 years, called his arrest an outrage. "They're putting me through the system like I'm a thug," he said. He called the mayor a "fascist" and referred to Mr. Kerik and Mr. Von Essen as "Giuliani's goons." <a href="http://snurl.com/1r3k5" class="external free" title="http://snurl.com/1r3k5" rel="nofollow">http://snurl.com/1r3k5</a>
</p><p>February 2002: Giulani transferred the $100 million of charitable donations remaining in the city-run Twin Towers Fund to a private charity he controlled, then bills himself for $2.2 million in administrative costs.
</p><p>September 2007: Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani urged NATO to admit Australia, India, Israel, Japan and Singapore on Wednesday as part of proposals to combat Islamic extremism. ... "This is no time for defeatism and appeasement," he said. <a href="http://snurl.com/1r3lm" class="external free" title="http://snurl.com/1r3lm" rel="nofollow">http://snurl.com/1r3lm</a>

<p>NYC Mayor Ed Koch on Giuliani: "He uses the levers of power to punish any critic. He doesn’t have that right. That’s why the First Amendment is so important and why I, on occasion, have referred to him as Pinochet, Caligula, maybe it’s a combination of the two."
</p><p>Professor George Kelling, co-author of the book Fixing Broken Windows, on Giuliani: "I really believe the Broken Windows argument is right and that it’s been verified. But the goal was never to turn it into an arrest effort. I think the NYPD lost the high moral ground for a period…The New York story certainly alerted us, that is in a democratic society you cannot try and do it by terror because the citizens will pull back away from you and nullify your actions."
