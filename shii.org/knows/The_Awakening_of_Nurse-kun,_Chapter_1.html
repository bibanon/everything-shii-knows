<p>/b/, I need your advice on something, since you're probably the ones most qualified to give it.
</p><p>I'm a nurse-orderly at a nursing home, been there for a year so far, I work the night shift on the west wing. It's not that tough, since most of the residents are so old and medicated that they sleep the night away, only rarely dying or stroking out or getting up to eat their own poop or something. I usually wind up playing with my DS or reading at the nurse's station for the full four hours I'm on watch alone, from 1 to 5.
</p><p>However, a new patient arrived a month ago, which got my attention. A seven year old girl that was in a car crash that killed her parents, and took her legs, right arm, and right eye. As a ward of the state, and so messed up by all the trauma mentally that no foster parents would touch her, she got sent here when she got out of the hospital. God, she's so cute, she's half-japanese, but has blonde hair, and the rest of her body that didn't get cut away is just perfect, she used to be a gymnast, it seems. I've had to answer her call button several times so far, when she's had to use the restroom in the middle of the night, which meant carrying her from her bed to the toilet, then holding her as she used it, and she always looks away from me when she did so, blushing a little bit.
</p>
<dl><dd><i>The part of the post below is a running joke on /b/, namely, that whenever you see a little kid you should rape him or her. The reason Nurse-kun posted this is because he thought at the time that nothing would come of this thread, and he was only posting it to amuse the other website visitors. He wasn't being serious in this paragraph. However, it did make some people worried and will be discussed endlessly in future chapters.</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>It isn't my job to "clean up" this story for your entertainment. You should take this for what it is: he saw a little girl at his unrewarding, difficult job, but felt it would be too risky to try to help her out in her painful situation, so instead he decided to come home and mouth off to other anonymous Internet users.</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>Anyway, my question: Should I stick it in her pooper (among other things)? I mean, she isn't going to be able to resist, and I can go in there when she's asleep, then cover up her good eye and mouth before she even knows I'm there, with all the drugs she's on. She's so messed up mentally that she probably wouldn't tell anyone, considering she's barely talked to all the shrinks they've had her seeing since the accident. I'm a pretty gentle guy, and there's plenty of lube around here (obviously), and it'd be pretty easy to clean her up afterward, too.
</p><p>Anyway, what do you think, /b/? Picture somewhat related.
</p>
<a name="17396238" id="17396238"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17396238 </span></h3>
<p>Well, she already has a bit of a reputation around here as a trouble patient, since she can become really aggressive when she gets frustrated. So she isn't so popular with the rest of the staff, and since she's so young, there's a lot more reluctance to show any 'inappropriate' affection toward her than, say, to some 90 year old that thinks Hitler's invading Paris every time she wakes up.
The main problem is that she's asleep most of the time I have her alone. What should I do?
</p>
<a name="17396426" id="17396426"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17396426 </span></h3>
<p>Well, I haven't taken any [pictures] yet (official policy is no photography by the staff for legal reasons, someone got busted in 2001 for taking pictures of the funny things senile old people do and posting them on the net), and I don't go back to work for another 10 hours. So I have no pictures of her to give you.
</p>
<a name="17396562" id="17396562"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17396562 </span></h3>
<p>Uh, yeah...they keep orphans with extreme medical and physical care needs in all the orphanages, the ones on every street corner. The ones with qualified nurses and doctors to manage their constant care. And they totally just toss the one-armed girl a bedpan, and cut the cord on the call button.
</p><p>Don't try and tell me how the system works, asshole, I'm part of the system, and it doesn't fucking work at all.
</p>
<a name="17396762" id="17396762"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17396762 </span></h3>
<p>And for all those people telling me to adopt her, I'd love to, she seems like she was a really great kid, bright, outgoing, cheerful, before the accident. The problem is that people involved in the care of kids in the system often find it way harder to adopt them than someone with a less sterling record from OUTSIDE the system. It's fucked up, but that's the way it is.
</p>
<a name="17397471" id="17397471"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17397471 </span></h3>
<p>Well, um...the problem is, if I'm nice to her, and treat her kindly, more as a friend or father-figure, she'd be likely, as a positive effect, to report it to the facility's psychiatrist during one of their sessions, in all innocence, who might then feel obligated to report that to the administrator. Who would then probably fire me for showing inappropriate affection, woo family services catch-22ism.
</p>
<a name="17397890" id="17397890"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17397890 </span></h3>
<p>I've considered that, too. I mean, she's actually REALLY smart, like, she was in a school for the gifted before the accident, and her mother was a child psychologist, so they gave her a lot more freedom and choice than the average kid would get. And she was pretty gifted athletically, too, which just makes the whole thing all the more tragic.
</p><p>Of course, she's also pretty broken now...extremely withdrawn, rare she says three words the whole day; at the same time, she lashes out at anyone that tries to get too close. She actually bit a psych intern who was trying some play therapy with her in the hospital hard enough to draw blood, before she was transferred here. The real problem is, if I were to try and form a bond with her, honestly, I'm afraid she'd do something to get me in trouble just to try and make me leave her alone, even if she really wants some affection.
</p><p>This would be a lot easier if she was less traumatized.
</p>
<a name="17398333" id="17398333"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17398333 </span></h3>
<p>Well, this is why I specified the pooper. I mean, they use adult-size colonoscopies on kid-sized colons, and they aren't sent straight from the imaging department to the ER for OMG RECTAL DISASTER.
</p><p>And you know, the main reason I would have not to post pictures is that she's a pretty distinctive girl. I mean, how many half-japanese blonde green-eyed (singular) one-armed, no-legged seven year olds are there? That idiot I mentioned before got busted just for posting random old people, and there are millions of those.
</p>
<a name="17398890" id="17398890"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17398890 </span></h3>
<p>Actually, she gets bussed to a rehab facility at the hospital almost every day, where she's learning to use prosthetic legs, and an arm. It's like it's the one thing she actually cares about anymore, I hear the staff there are amazed at the progress she's making.
</p><p>It makes sense, though, because she really hates her wheelchair...the first time I answered one of her calls at night, I'd wheeled it out to put her in it, since that's standard procedure, but she asked me not to use it, so I carried her, instead. I guess that's the first time I thought about her in an illegal manner, really.
</p><p>Anyway, she wears the prosthetic arm during the day, but I'm not around then, so I've never actually seen her using it. I have seen it in her room, though; it's a nice model, probably the best in the whole facility. I guess her parents had a pretty responsible life insurance policy, so she doesn't have to deal with substandard prosthetics, at least...has a nice prosthetic eye, too, looks just like her real one, as much as a fake one can, anyway. Of course, the scarring over her eye kind of helps give it away.
</p>
<a name="17399199" id="17399199"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17399199 </span></h3>
<p>I know, I know. I mean, I'd prefer not to rape, too! It's just that it's a really complex situation, and this is /b/. I figured I'd get 'stick it in her pooper' out of the way, to get more productive responses.
</p>
<a name="17400270" id="17400270"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17400270 </span></h3>
<p>I'll bring her something christmasy tonight...she's been getting especially depressed since the facility started putting up decorations a week ago, poor kid. Good way to see how receptive she is to interacting with me outside emergencies, too.
</p><p>Not sure what'd be 'appropriate' or disposable enough, though...I know you're hardly the people to ask about 'appropriate' anything, but any ideas, /b/?
</p>
<a name="17401287" id="17401287"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17401287 </span></h3>
<p>No, I'm still here, I was just grabbing something from the kitchen. Cute attempt at internet dramas with the flooding, though. And *I'm* the cancer that is killing /b/? Nigra, please.
</p><p>And for the record, I had actually thought about the red prosthetic eye thing myself once, embarassed as I am to admit it. I'm not that big a Rozen Fag, though.
</p><p>(Though, she will have some delicious prosjoints...)
</p>
<a name="17402270" id="17402270"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17402270 </span></h3>
<p>Sure they can. I mean, I've seen one myself (you know, in her room). Apparently, her father was almost stereotypically scandanavian, bright blonde hair, blue eyes, six foot+, etc. She's still got pretty clearly Japanese-y features, mostly (luckily, of the cute kind, not the 'oh god, i see why the men raped nanking' kind), but most of her coloration is equally pretty clearly from his side of the family. Her skin is somewhere in between a pale japanese and a pale (rather than goldish) fjordish.
</p><p>Frankly, I'd say she won the genetic lottery, too bad about the non-predetermined alterations.
</p>
<a name="17403691" id="17403691"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17403691 </span></h3>
<p>Ok, OP here: I won't be poopering her in the foreseeable future. I mean, when /b/ can come down at least in the slight minority against doing a barrel roll into a loli, it clearly isn't the right course of action, though I guess I did know that already.
</p><p>I really wish I could get you guys a recording of her voice. She doesn't have an accent, because she was born and raised here in America, and her mother (the Japanese half) comes from a long line of Japanese-Americans (who disowned her, I guess, when she married Mr. Swedish Meatball, because loli's relatives/contact information is nonexistent, just social workers), but her voice...well, it's just the most beautiful thing I'd ever heard, when she first spoke to me (about the wheelchair).
</p><p>Even as flat and brusque as it was, it was like hearing an angel whisper hymns, and I still get goosebumps every time I've heard it since. I can't wait for tonight...I think I should bring her something else, maybe a tiny little keychain sized stuffed doll or something, or maybe a little wristband...any other ideas, guys?
</p>
<a name="17403984" id="17403984"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17403984 </span></h3>
<p>Um, I have to admit, she didn't seem to get at all distressed until she may have possibly noticed me looking down there, which I quickly stopped doing, just before I caught her looking away as well, out of my peripheral vision.
</p><p>I was being pretty unprofessional, it's true, since I'd never had any inclination to look at any other of my patients taking a piss before, but then, half of my patients before her were in depends, and the other half, well, I prayed for their merciful deaths every time.
</p><p>She's not a robot, or animuishly designed to be the perfect cold-hearted Rei-clone. She's a real girl.
</p>
<a name="17404193" id="17404193"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17404193 </span></h3>
<p>I'll bring it up at next week's meeting...perhaps a possibility of allowing individual gifts, with the potential that it could improve morale with the rest of the patients to grandparent her a bit (well, the non-racists, anyway).
</p><p>This is just for tonight. Babysteps...
</p>

<dl><dd> <i>To the OP - I'm in a similiar situation. my older sister is 20years old when she was 18 she was involved in a car crash which resulted in her becoming a vegetable. My mother is divorced and at night when my mother goes to work i have to bath my mentally retarded sister and while bathing her i cant resists but to just finger her until she cums in the bath. I cant help it i no its wrong but its the biggest turn on ever.</i>

<a name="17407403" id="17407403"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 17407403 </span></h3>
<dl><dd> <i>Note: This was in response to some asshole on /b/ saying that her life was fucked and he would make it worse. Of course, one could theorize that he was just trolling, but it was kinda scathing. So, as you can see, the OP kicks major ass in a winning retort.</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>So, what's your solution?
</p><p>Magically turn back time to make the accident not have happened? Magically heal her mind so that her body's imperfections alone are less likely to destroy her future? Maybe you could magically heal both of them, and she'd probably be adopted right away.
</p><p>There is no magic. The world doesn't work like that. She has no future, not a future she deserves, anyway.
</p><p>The fact of the matter is that I'm probably her best chance for a future worth living, one way or another. You may not want to admit it, but it's the truth. Go fuck the holes you cut in your son's dolls and cry yourself to sleep over the injustices of the world if you aren't strong enough to face them, fag.

<p>OP here, I should clarify to whoever made the wiki entry that the last post was actually the last of a three-part post on my part, as a response to the same poster. So if they have a copy of the thread handy, they may want to correct that.
</p><p>That said, I need to get ready for dinner, then hit the mall before heading in to work. Need to pick up that stuff for her that I'd mentioned...wish me luck, guys, and thanks for the productive advice I was given. Food for thought.
</p><p>The rest of you fags can go fuck yourselves.
