<dl><dd>(This was supposed to be an actual script for the gameplay)
</dd></dl>
<p>Rough draft. Not for public consumption
</p><p>PRELUDE
</p><p>At the end of a long room filled with whispers and handshakes sits a man fondling a small, dark object. The ancient wooden benches along the room's perimeter are full, mostly of women and children, leaving the men to mingle. The man sits firmly offering avoiding eye contact which could be misinterpreted as an offer of his seat. He clutches the object nervously. Through a forrest of arms, legs, and coattails a small child wanders towards the man, drawn by curiousity and free of her unattentive mother's eye.
</p><p>"What you got there, mister?", queries the girl.
</p><p>He pauses for a moment, considering plots which might've employed this child as a spy, paid in food, to inquire. Exhausted and drawn to the child's innocence, the walls of secrecy melt for a moment.
</p><p>"This, my darling, is a device. A device many men and many women have died to see, to understand, and to own. In many ways it is like one of your toys, but a toy for adults. This, darling, is The Zybourne Clock."
</p><p>Suddenly, barely visible in the dim light, the child's eyes change. The hazelnut brown tones are ungluing into silver, melting into swirls of pearl and mechanical shades. Her body loses its shy posture and rapidly conforms to a rigid, upright stance. Her mouth opens slightly and with programmed precision, she moves her wrist slowly towards her tiny lips.
</p><p>"Orange Fox to Deitrus. Orange Fox to Deitrus. The Golden Egg has been located. I repeat, we've got it. Over".
</p><p>Frozen with guilt, the man slowly begins to run through the crowd. The girl screams, "Rape! Rape! He tried to touch me! Help!".
</p><p>For Dirk McLauren, Wedesnday January 19 2381 has begun very poorly.

<a name="Time" id="Time"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Time</span></h2>
<dl><dd>(This was also real)
</dd></dl>
<p>We had all the main logistics points of our projects hammered out and our prototype built, but there was a few more things to
</p><p>be decided. What would this clock do when it gets back in time besides gather energy? The answer came to me while reading an
</p><p>article out of a Science magazine that I had picked up about 2 years ago. The article basically summarized how the planet got
</p><p>to its current point in its evolutionary cycle and where it had started. It compared key points of life over 20 millenia and
</p><p>now. I sat there in and thought about the article for a good 3 hours. If we could subtely alter the cycle at which the
</p><p>planet terraforms and speed up human evolution, we could, possibly make humanity advance far past wars in a few millenia's
</p><p>time. My heart jumped into my throat as I ran through the bay doors to tell my colleagues that I had finally found a safe way
</p><p>to alter the way the timeline to such a degree as to not rip a hole in time itself.
</p><p>As I looked around the room, my excitement faded. All of them looked as if they had just became very ill.
</p><p>"Doctor, you understand if we do this, We will fade from existance as the timeline corrects itself." One of my colleagues
</p><p>said in the grimest manner I had ever heard him speak before.
</p><p>I began to turn pale, and dizzy. I quickly found a chair and used the magazine (that I was subsequently still clutching) to
</p><p>fan myself.
</p><p>"Well, there must be a way around this. There must be." I said, even though I knew I was lying to myself.
</p><p>We sat up that night and discuss ideas on how to develope a new one. What we came up with was grim. We theorized that when
</p><p>you send an object through time, it does not create a new timeline that overrides the current like we had originally thought.
</p><p>When the object enters the timestream, time begins to correct itself. Let me use this example: <b>Imagine four balls on the edge</b>
</p><p><b>of a cliff. Say a direct copy of the ball nearest the cliff is sent to the back of the line of balls and takes the place of</b>
</p><p><b>the first ball. The formerly first ball becomes the second, the second becomes the third, and the fourth falls off the cliff.</b>
</p><p><b>Time works the same way.</b>

<dl><dd>(This was how character moods were to be determined)
</dd></dl>
<p>Okay, now that we have that down, there is another thing that I should point out. Some enemies will have immunities to
</p><p>certain moods during points in the battle. Look at the battle flow chart. You see where you used moodskills, and where he
</p><p>attacked you, where you attacked him, and now where he is about to use the Moodskill rage and during the turn he will be
</p><p>immune to the emotion anger.
</p><p>That means that Sylus's strenghtMAX skill will be negated and his attack rating will return back to normal for this turn, but
</p><p>the negative effect of the skill will remain on him, so it is best to defend to make up for lost defense points on this turn.
</p><p>Okay, so the battle menu opens, select defense please!
</p><p>On to Alex! She is unaffected by the anger immunity because she is tense! So you can attack with her!
</p><p>Good!
</p><p>Next few things I want to cover. The change mood command will change the selected characters mood at random. It can only be
</p><p>used once in battle. You can also use an item to change a characters mood by using an item or by seeing a Psychologist. Okay,
</p><p>Ill let you do the rest! Look forward to our next and final installment of tutorials, Timesynch!
</p><p>Oh yeah one more thing.

<p>Johnny Fiveaces powered down the magnabike with a not quite unhearble hum and checked his chronometer. “Damn.” he hissed threw his clinched teeth which were surrounded by the stubble of five days where in he had not shaven himself at all. It was almost chromodawn at Clashpoint. Alreddy the sun was sitting Walliston’s Hill ah blaze like so much molten meddle or a coin, gyreating in the air, tossed there by the uncaring hand of an imaginary god that doesn’t exist, borne from the interior minds of the hobbled masses. The sky was the color of a television tuned to a dead channel that was orange. Damn, he, Johnny, thought. We thought we were opening a new beginning with our mad dreams of time travail but ironically the only time now is the time of which we’re out of. It’s almost humorous. Yeah, I could almost laugh, if I hadn’t cried that part of me away when my parents were maccasared by Dr. Malaprop and the government sanctioned murderers of “CAPITAL”.
</p><p>He lit a Nicosheen brand swaggerette and took a dip drag, sinking farther into his inferior horologue. He thought of Nina and her mellifluous buttocks that he used to love to bang. Even now his nano enhanced hearing could almost hear her vagina lips quivering with moisture and also pleasure, like a slice of synth-ham being tongued by one of Malaprop’s slamhounds. When he got back to City5, he was going to do some sex, no doubt about that. “That’s right doll” he said to nobody and the wind. They were going to do it hard. He smiled, blowing smoke from his nostrils. They were going to do it cyber hard.
