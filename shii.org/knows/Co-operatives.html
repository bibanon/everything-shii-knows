<div id='article'><p>The <b>co-operative</b> is a successful, mutually beneficial system of production which has been systematically suppressed from business schools, economics classes, and Marxist theory throughout the world.
</p><p>In a corporation, workers have no say in the company's goals, which are determined by a board of elites and a group of outsiders whose only aim is to make money (shareholders). In a co-operative, the <i>organization is controlled by the workers</i>, who make decisions that will benefit themselves.
</p><p>Some of the <i>obvious</i> problems solved by co-operatives:
</p>
<ul><li> Worker exploitation. No worker would use an organization to exploit himself.
</li><li> Outsourcing. No worker would use an organization to fire himself!!
</li><li> CEO pay. No worker would use an organization to vote to take an unreasonable money from himself and give it to an upper manager.
</li></ul>
<p>Main problem of a co-operative:
</p>
<ul><li> Horizontal and vertical integration, which can streamline production, distract a co-operative from its motives (to support its workers) by including different kinds of workers in the voting process. But competition, the main tool of economics, is still quite in force; the economy would still run smoothly if all our corporations became co-operatives, we'd just have more businesses, and smaller ones.
</li></ul>
<a name="Co-operatives_succeed_in_a_free_market" id="Co-operatives_succeed_in_a_free_market"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Co-operatives succeed in a free market</span></h2>
<p>Co-operatives are not only successful, they have demonstrated success in a free market to the extent that you already recognize their brands, and most people don't even realize the brands represent "non-profit". Here are some examples of co-operatives today:
</p>
<ul><li> Ocean Spray - cranberry growers
</li><li> Best Western - hotels
</li><li> Land'O'Lakes - farmers
</li><li> FTD - florists
</li><li> R.E.I. - outdoors equipment
</li><li> Sunkist - orange growers
</li><li> Cabot - cheese
</li></ul>
<p>These organizations function like normal corporations. They invest in R&amp;D and clean up after themselves. They advertise, operate efficiently, and lobby Congress. But they do all of this in a way that is satisfying to the owners of the company-- <i>its employees</i>.
</p>
<a name="Co-operatives_are_systematically_suppressed" id="Co-operatives_are_systematically_suppressed"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Co-operatives are systematically suppressed</span></h2>
<p>In the business world, neoclassical economists starting with Nobel Prize winner Paul Samelson have aimed to suppress the existence of the co-op from economics-- by <i>omitting it from textbooks and classes</i>. They replaced it with a fairy tale that runs like this: "When a group of people wish to work together to produce something, they can sell it all under an individual's name, work in a partnership and share culpability like lawyers, or create a corporation run by shareholders, creating a profit motive."
</p><p>This is one of the biggest lies you will be taught in economics class. A corporation need not have transferable shares. In fact, it is <i>against the interest of the community, society, and the planet</i> to make shares transferable. But this goes unexamined. The haphazard way the corporation was set up in the 19th century, which you can learn about by watching the movie <i>The Corporation</i>, is obviously not the only way it could have worked. The alternative-- the co-operative-- is the way it should have happened.
</p><p>Some papers noting this:
</p>
<ul><li> Chamard, John (2004). "Co-operatives and credit unions in economics and business texts: changing the paradigm" The International Journal of Co-operative Management Vol. 1, No.2, 34 – 40.
</li><li> Hill, Roderick (2000). "The Case of the Missing Organizations: Co-operatives and the Textbooks" Journal of Economic Education (Summer)
</li><li> Kalmi, Panu (2007). "The disappearance of cooperatives from economics textbooks." Cambridge Journal of Economics vol. 31, No. 4.
</li><li> Lynch, Lori, Marilee Urban and Robert Sommer (1989). "De-emphasis on Cooperatives in Introductory Economics Textbooks" Journal of Agricultural Cooperation Vol. 4.
</li></ul>
<p>(These papers are summarized in <a href="http://sec.oise.utoronto.ca/english/project_outputs/19DS_talk.pdf" class="external text" title="http://sec.oise.utoronto.ca/english/project_outputs/19DS_talk.pdf" rel="nofollow">Daniel Schugurensky's talk, "What knowledge is of least worth?”</a>)
</p><p>The theory that has been invented as an alternative to the damaging and inherently unequal corporation is Marxism. Marxism has never worked in practice; co-operatives have. Yet Marxists ignore the co-operative as a system of production.
