</li><li> Notable events: Hillary looked good in this debate. Gravel once again called out Obama, but Wolf Blitzer carefully limited his questions.

</li><li> Notable events: Refreshing questions from YouTube viewers made this a good debate for all the mainstream candidates. Made the Democratic Party look great. Even Hillary had an impressive performance. Gravel and Kucinich, on the other hand, were unable to confront the directness of the questions and looked a little crazy.

</li><li> Notable events: I didn't even know this happened so I didn't watch it. Way too many debates! Smooth, no-nonsense moderation by Keith Olbermann. Kucinich <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzgbnjuBGN8" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzgbnjuBGN8" rel="nofollow">railed against NAFTA</a>.

</li><li> Notable events: A remarkably unclassy performance by the ABC moderator who asked stupid questions about Obama and Hillary rather than focusing the debate on policy and key issues. One to miss.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Univision at Coral Gables, FL, 9/9/07
<ul><li> No video; nothing happened

<ul><li> <b>Full video: <a href="http://debates.news.yahoo.com/" class="external text" title="http://debates.news.yahoo.com/" rel="nofollow">Yahoo! News (Official)</a></b>
</li><li> Notable events: A good debate to pull up on your computer. Charlie Rose quizzes each candidate at length; you can pick your favorite choices and watch their extended explanations of various important issues. Gravel makes a strong humanitarian impression on Iraq (and Slate agrees with me this time), although it is clear at this point that he is not electable.

</li><li> Notable events: Mike Gravel is a crazy old man. Obama floundered, Hillary soaked in the high levels of support and maintained her place on top. However, to me personally her answers were extremely unsatisfying. I didn't like this debate. Also, the moderator is a butt.
</li></ul>
</li><li> NBC in in Philadelphia, PA, 10/30/07
<ul><li> <b>Full video: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5474484778519250093" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5474484778519250093" rel="nofollow">Google Video</a></b>
</li><li> Notable events: Gravel was missing!! He gave a <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/Gravel2008/videos/lYSUmY,gpZixLmp7zuvXQA" class="external text" title="http://www.ustream.tv/Gravel2008/videos/lYSUmY,gpZixLmp7zuvXQA" rel="nofollow">commentary on the debate instead</a>, which was both revealing and far more interesting than the real thing. I didn't even bother watching it after Gravel got bored with the commentary, but here's the summary: Edwards bashed Hillary; Obama decided not to; Bill Richardson was an egomaniac; Hillary "lost" the debate, boo hoo hoo.
</li></ul>
</li><li> CNN at University of Nevada, 11/15/07
<ul><li> <b>Full video: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6493038125196981142" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6493038125196981142" rel="nofollow">Google Video</a></b>
</li><li> Notable events: This was the Hillary-Obama debate. The moderator, Wolf Blitzer, sucked balls and should never be allowed to moderate anything ever again. Gravel was once again missing.
</li></ul>
</li><li> HDNet in Des Moines, IA, 12/1/07

</li><li> Notable events: Only Iowans got to watch this live; even fewer people watched it online. The main event here was that Kucinich abused the debate format to ask himself a question, which was amusing, but didn't do much to improve his image.
</li></ul>
</li><li> NPR in Des Moines, IA, 12/4/07
<ul><li> <b>Full audio: <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16895315" class="external text" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16895315" rel="nofollow">NPR (Official)</a></b>
</li><li> Notable events: <b>WOW!</b> This is THE debate to listen to if you're serious about making an informed choice in the Democratic primaries. Superb moderation, great in-depth discussions. Without judging the candidates, I'd like to say that this was by far the most enlightening debate and you could hear the ground behind all their rhetoric. I wish the Republicans would go on NPR, too! Now, some biased judgements I made while listening: Hillary didn't sound as experienced as she makes out to be. Edwards used whiny socialist rhetoric to promote center-right politics, which struck me as incredibly obnoxious. Kucinich sounded like a used-car salesman, and Gravel would have done better to be one of the moderators, or simply get his own talk radio show. Obama stood out. Obama is really the man who needs to win this. If you don't think I could glean all this from one two-hour debate, listen for yourself.

</li><li> Notable events: Another superb debate by nonprofit media. Surprise, surprise! Time was divided up evenly between candidates. The best performers were Obama and Biden, who demonstrated both their cerebral power and their strength of character. Runners up were Edwards and Dodd. Richardson, a bore, got too much time. Skip his answers, he's not going to be President.

</li><li> Notable events: A number of pithy sound bites from minor candidates. McCain lost this debate, by looking soft-- Mitt Romney won it, by expanding his formidable name recognition. Giuliani got himself into a long argument with Ron Paul about interventionism and blowback. Giuliani was applauded and it seemed good for him at first, but roughly a week after the debate Paul fired back by telling Giuliani to go read a book.

</li><li> Notable events: Haven't watched this one yet. MSM reports that Romney flopped, McCain looked decent, Ron Paul got applause.

</li><li> Notable events: Giuliani spewed BS. Romney floundered (although this was not widely reported). Several candidates came out in support of the FairTax! Ron Paul got applause, but he clearly was not in the limelight.

</li><li> Notable events: A pathetic showing by Romney and Giuliani. McCain and Paul looked great-- in fact, they looked like the only sane people on the stage. FOX News, as expected, turned their moderating powers into nasty mudslinging by openly laughing at Paul whenever he was asked a question.

</li><li> Notable events: Frontrunners didn't show up. Despite his lukewarm answers and tough love on welfare, Ron Paul got huge applause from minority audience, surprising many.

</li><li> CNBC in Michigan, 10/9/07
<ul><li> <b>Full video:</b> <i>You don't want to watch this. Seriously, it was a snoozefest.</i>
</li><li> Notable events: Huh? There was a debate? Oh yeah, I was watching this... then I fell asleep... just like the two women I was watching it with, and probably most of the rest of the audience too. CBS deleted its poll after Ron Paul won overwhelmingly, leading to not <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/21257762/site/14081545/" class="external text" title="http://www.cnbc.com/id/21257762/site/14081545/" rel="nofollow">one</a>, but <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/21270546" class="external text" title="http://www.cnbc.com/id/21270546" rel="nofollow">two</a> official responses.

</li><li> Notable events: I only caught the tail-end of this one. Ron Paul was booed by the audience, for the first time. Nevertheless he won the FOX News poll by a huge margin, and Hannity fumed.

<a name="The_Democrats" id="The_Democrats"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Democrats</span></h3>
<ul><li> <a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/" rel="nofollow">Hillary Clinton</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Would be first woman president. Would also be the most calculated, cunning president ever. Honest politicians will be forced to cringe and bear it as she coasts her way to the presidency.
</li><li> Electoral-vote.com says: "Hillary Clinton scares the daylights out of BOTH parties."
</li><li> Shii thinks: Sigh... Hillary wins. Unless if <i>you</i> can help unseat her she is riding the wave all the way to the White House.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.barackobama.com/" rel="nofollow">Barack Obama</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Would be first black president. Returned lobbyist donations. Focuses on non-divisive issues. Universal health care. Would allow states to legalize medical marijuana.
</li><li> Electoral-vote.com says: "Barack Obama is experiencing a bit of a boomlet now, but a young (46) black freshman senator with no foreign policy experience is an inviting target for the Republicans."
</li><li> Shii thinks: Obama got a great start with a hopeful message, but some, including myself, have been disillusioned by his Kerry-esque faceless campaign. Right now, Obama is the candidate of everybody and nobody. If he wants to win he's going to have to take a principled position on big issues, such as the drug war.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.johnedwards.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.johnedwards.com/" rel="nofollow">John Edwards</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Universal health care. Strong on poverty. Was first to pull out of Fox News debate.
</li><li> Electoral-vote.com says: "John Edwards has a lot going for him. He is well known, from the South, and knows how to run a national campaign."
</li><li> Shii thinks: Kossacks love him. Why? He's just palatable enough not to upset their stomachs talking about the <a href="NAFTA.html" title="NAFTA">truth</a>, and just liberal enough to lose.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.richardsonforpresident.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.richardsonforpresident.com/" rel="nofollow">Bill Richardson</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Generic center-right candidate. Could legalize marijuana. Gets the Freeper vote for some bizarre reason.
</li><li> Electoral-vote.com says: "A Richardson candidacy could potentially bring in New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado, all of which have sizeable and growing Hispanic populations."
</li><li> Shii thinks: He just isn't prepared enough. He's a good governor but doesn't have the necessary experience with national issues.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.kucinich.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.kucinich.us/" rel="nofollow">Dennis Kucinich</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Extreme liberal, very strong on peace and welfare, almost hippie-ish. Would repeal PATRIOT Act, remove US from WTO and NAFTA. Universal health care. Introduced bills to impeach Bush and Cheney. Would legalize marijuana.
</li><li> Electoral-vote.com says: "His main problem is that with a real horse race this time between Hillary, Obama, Edwards, and maybe others, few Democrats are likely to make a protest vote for him when they actually have a real choice in influencing who the nominee is."
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.chrisdodd.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.chrisdodd.com/" rel="nofollow">Chris Dodd</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Very articulate and concrete on positions (compare Obama, Hillary). Campaign is running an interesting blog. Would legalize medical marijuana.
</li><li> Shii thinks: If I weren't so fed up with the Democrats I'd find Dodd a good choice. He's an honest man. But he is currently being <i>outpolled</i> by Mike Gravel! A choice between Gravel and Dodd would be no contest--let's bring some comedy back to the White Houe.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.joebiden.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.joebiden.com/" rel="nofollow">Joe Biden</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Knows a lot about Iraq. Some of the other candidates clearly haven't thought their Iraq policies through. Outspoken (and well spoken) on other subjects, too.
</li><li> Shii thinks: A protest vote, perhaps.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.gravel2008.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.gravel2008.us/" rel="nofollow">Mike Gravel</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore.
</li><li> Shii thinks: He had a great performance in the beginning, but I agree with <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/8/7/173927/6814" class="external text" title="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/8/7/173927/6814" rel="nofollow">Kos</a>: Gravel doesn't take himself seriously enough to challenge the big candidates like he ought to be doing. He isn't living up to his grand legacy--a hero of the Nixon era. (Update: Although, his "alternative debate" speech was pretty excellent and reaffirmed his viability as a protest vote.)

<a name="The_Republicans" id="The_Republicans"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Republicans</span></h3>
<ul><li> <a href="Ron_Paul.html" title="Ron Paul">Ron Paul</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Would strip federal government of all wasteful departments and laws not specifically authorized in the Constitution. Would defend the entire Bill of Rights, including much-neglected 10th Amendment. Would remove US from NAFTA, eliminate IRS, and legalize marijuana (as none of these things are the federal government's responsibility). Strongly pro-Internet, with sweeping support from netroots which has never been seen in any election before. Internet supporters are getting him invited to debates and added to the polls on major news websites.
</li><li> Shii thinks: A remarkably smart guy, compared to the other Republicans. Some support from the other side of the aisle could make him a serious threat to the other candidates.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.joinrudy2008.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.joinrudy2008.com/" rel="nofollow">Rudy Giuliani</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: 9/11 lol.
</li><li> Electoral-vote.com says: "None of the serious pundits believe Giuliani will survive the mudfest that will start when the primaries get closer."
</li><li> Shii thinks: <a href="Rudy_Giulianihtml.html" title="Rudy Giuliani">An enormous threat to democracy and the world.</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.johnmccain.com/" rel="nofollow">John McCain</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: A conservative without adjectives. Extremely smart and honest.
</li><li> Shii thinks: This poor guy never stood a chance against the propaganda-spewing neocons.
</li><li> Electoral-vote.com says: "John McCain came into this race as the clear front runner, but in a few short months all that has changed."
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.mittromney.com/" rel="nofollow">Mitt Romney</a>
<ul><li> Reasons <b>not</b> to vote: I speak from personal experience here. Romney is a huge jerk who spent most of his time as <a href="Massachusettshtml.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> governor parading around campaigning for president. He didn't care one ounce for his constituents and flip-flopped on things such as abortion to best suit the voters he was aiming for.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.gohunter08.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.gohunter08.com/" rel="nofollow">Duncan Hunter</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Would amend Constitution to outlaw abortion. Would amend Constitution to define marriage as man-woman. Would increase marriage benefits. Would allow parents to sue anyone who distributes disturbing material. Would prevent crimes against gays from being called "hate" crimes. 
</li><li> Shii thinks: A home-grown Freeper favorite. If you're crazy but not as crazy as Tancredo, support this guy.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.mikehuckabee.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.mikehuckabee.com/" rel="nofollow">Mike Huckabee</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: He doesn't like John Edwards' hair. Ha ha.
</li><li> Shii thinks: Excites the Republican base with his honest attitude and funny-man campaign, but I would roll my eyes out of my own head if he were in the general election.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.cox2008.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.cox2008.com" rel="nofollow">John Cox</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Would eliminate the IRS.
</li><li> Shii thinks: Docking the IRS is a good idea, but Cox was excluded from the debates and polls due to lack of experience.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://fred08.com/" class="external text" title="http://fred08.com/" rel="nofollow">Fred Thompson</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: A dark horse who could triumph over all three major candidates.
</li><li> Shii thinks: Literally the sleeper candidate. He took three months to get out of bed, he puts his audiences to sleep, and it seems like he just woke up from 1989.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Alan Keyes
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: WTF?!

<ul><li> <a href="http://www.mesplay.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.mesplay.org" rel="nofollow">Kent Mesplay</a>
<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Would end NAFTA. Focuses on decentralization. Universal health care implemented at a local level.
</li><li> Shii thinks: Strong, smart policies on his website. A good guy to vote for to promote a viable, electable alternative to the major parties.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <a href="http://www.elainebrown.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.elainebrown.org" rel="nofollow">Elaine Brown</a>

<ul><li> Reasons to vote: Doesn't capitalize her name. THE candidate to vote for if you spell your name a weird way.
</li><li> Shii thinks: I didn't even read the rest of her page. When I saw the "don't capitalize my name" thing I knew she wasn't serious.
