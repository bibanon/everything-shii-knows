<p>The successful propagation of this hoax basically worked like any other content manipulation on Wikipedia. First, a user unfamiliar with the inner workings of Wikipedia noticed the article was utterly false and tried to tell people so. Then, Wikipedians who were "unsure" if it was true or not reversed the newbie's attempt to get rid of it. Finally, a malicious user familiar with how Wikipedia works (who apparently hates Hinduism or something) kicked the newbie around and eventually got him permanently banned, simply for trying to fix a major mistake.
</p>
<a name="Original_hoax_article" id="Original_hoax_article"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Original hoax article</span></h2>
<p><b>Brahmanical See</b> refers to the domain of certain <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Hinduism&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hinduism (page does not exist)">Hindu</a> leaders in the <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Indian_subcontinent&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Indian subcontinent (page does not exist)">Indian subcontinent</a>.  Because it is essentially an anglicized term, this nomenclature has begun to fall into disuse.
</p><p>Much like the former Indian principalities, which varied in scale from small estates to vast kingdoms, the brahmanical sees range from minor parishes to quasi-states.
</p><p>With Hinduism itself lacking any central organizing institutions, it is common for brahmanical sees to geographically overlap with one another, just as the sees of different Christian denominations can coexist within a shared geography.
</p><p>A religious leader over a Brahmanical See is typically known as a "maharaj", or in European terms, a "prince of the faith".  The office is generally passed down the generations in the male line within an extended family, though not necessarily from father to son.
</p><p>Again, similar to the tensions which existed in medieval Europe between the <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Holy_See&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Holy See (page does not exist)">papacy</a> and the <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Aristocracy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Aristocracy (page does not exist)">aristocracy</a>, tensions between the brahmanical maharajs and the royal <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Maharaja&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Maharaja (page does not exist)">maharajas</a> furnished the main political narrative in many parts of <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=India&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="India (page does not exist)">India</a>.  The brahmanical maharajs could bestow or withhold the legitimacy without which royal maharajas could not  reign, and the royal maharajas could extend or withdraw the military protection without which brahmanical maharajs might not survive.
</p><p>The longest established brahmanical sees are the Brahmanical See of <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Rajasthan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rajasthan (page does not exist)">Rajasthan</a> (which contains a large number of kingdoms), the Brahmanical See of <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Mysore&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mysore (page does not exist)">Mysore</a> (whose borders are coterminal with those of the Kingdom of Mysore), and the Brahmanical See of <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Dabra&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dabra (page does not exist)">Dabra</a> (which is one of several sees contained within the Kingdom of <a href="http://shii.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Gwalior&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gwalior (page does not exist)">Gwalior</a>).
</p><p>With the dissolution of the old kingdoms and the coming of modernity, the importance of the brahmanical sees declined sharply in the last quarter century.  The see of Rajasthan is now held by an Indo-Canadian, the see of Mysore is disputed by three claimants, and the see of Dabra has been allowed to lapse entirely.
