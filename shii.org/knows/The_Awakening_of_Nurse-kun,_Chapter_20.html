<p>Hey, /b/. Another week, another explosion of shit, a veritable shitsunami, if you will. But this isn't really about me, as I well know, so I'll get to what you're actually interested in, those of you that aren't about to call me a fag.
</p><p>When it comes to my girl, much of the aforementioned shit wasn't so bad, but there wasn't really anything xyber huge that happened, either. Still, stuff did happen, as it always does in life, so I'll try and relay some of the interesting bits.
</p>
<a name="24183426" id="24183426"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24183426 </span></h3>
<p>First thing that springs to mind is another incident at rehab. This one happened in the pool, however, rather than her more-commonly utilized walking area. Pool therapy hasn't been as central to her rehab as it is in paralysis cases, since her (remaining) legs and lower body still have the strength and control they had before the accident (maybe more now, actually), so 'water-walking' isn't really that helpful to her. Still, swimming is an excellent form of exercise, so she still winds up getting wet at least once every couple weeks or so.
</p><p>The problem is, however, that she doesn't like being there very much. Unlike her walking rehab, where she gives it everything she has and more or less looks forward to doing so, she doesn't like the pool...largely because it means wearing a swimsuit and feeling more 'exposed' than she does on land. She has a set of 'swimming limbs', which are comprised of a set of hollow legs with holes to let water in, to reduce buoyancy, and with a special ankle that locks in an extended position, and a similar arm. They're simple, really, but work well enough.
</p>
<a name="24184494" id="24184494"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24184494 </span></h3>
<p>She was offered a more specialized swimming arm with a folding flexible 'paddle', but refused it, at least for the time being. She already stands out enough, I suppose, without making it 'worse', in her mind...which is at the root of why she's uncomfortable there. While there are a few other kids with missing limbs there as well, it doesn't seem to help much with her feeling like she 'fits in', particularly since none of them have her level of loss, with the only other triple-amputee currently in the facilitee being an ex-army reservist in his forties. And the simple fact that while she's doing her 'land training', she wears long sleeves over her arm, and long shorts, generally, at the least, that cover her thighs, whereas at the pool, all of that is exposed.
</p><p>Anyway...there she was, doing the swim-thing, her aquatic rehab nurse right alongside her in the water as she made her way back and forth...she was a pretty good swimmer before the accident, so she doesn't have to deal with basic skills, at least, though she still has trouble with diving and surfacing, as opposed to simply staying on the surface and moving along it. There weren't many problems with the actual planned swimming part.
</p>
<a name="24185342" id="24185342"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24185342 </span></h3>
<p>The problem came when her nurse called a break, and helped her (the legs aren't really made for walking, particularly with her level of amputation) to a bench to sit and rest for a bit, then headed over to talk with a friend of hers at a station about half the pool-length away. Things went uneventfully for five minutes or so, with her sitting there, sipping a sports drink (since she sweats a good deal more than fully-limbed kid her size, she also needs to replensih a good deal more) and looking generally uncomfortable, probably; then trouble surfaced when another girl took a seat a few feet away from her. From what I've heard, this one, a couple years older than her, lost her arms in an unspecified accident, and had been an avid swimmer beforehand, so was working hard at that part of rehab, much like our girl was with her walking.
</p><p>So they'd have a fair amount in common, bond, and be BFF, right? You'd hope so...but things rarely go so well in reality.
</p>
<a name="24185890" id="24185890"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24185890 </span></h3>
<p>Now, I don't have the details on what went down, as she was somewhat recalcitrant in providing all the details, though she did discuss other aspects of the incident with me. And since the two of them were the only ones around at that point, I guess those details are only going to be known to them until they decide otherwise.
</p><p>But something did go down. As she put it, the other girl, who's apparently white, pretty, from a reasonably well-off family, and still pretty new to her disability, even moreso than our girl, actually, after they'd exchanged a few normal words, said something 'mean'. She then admitted that she said something 'mean' in return, and things went back and forth, with her getting agitated and more aggressive, and the other girl behaving similarly...considering what happened to her, she may have PSTD too, really, support from family and friends and such or not.
</p>
<a name="24187079" id="24187079"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24187079 </span></h3>
<p>Things got more heated, though it seems that it was a slow burn, since nobody that was supposed to be in a position of authority seemed to have noticed. The other girl stood up and moved to loom over her as they continued exchanging words...and a few moments later, she splashed the older girl in the face with her drink, giving her a blue moneyshot. Well, that's when the gloves, so to speak, came off, and the older girl, who'd switched her swimming arms for her usual ones, slapped the bottle out of our girl's hand with one of them, and gave her a nasty smack in the cheek with her steel hooks with the other.
</p><p>By this time both of them had raised their voices and were attracting some attention, and the older girl had gotten a grip on her hair with one of her hooks, was pinching her side with the other; she'd managed to grab one of the other girl's arms with her left hand, meanwhile, and pulled herself up to a standing position, while shoving her plastic right hand and forearm into the other girl's face, squishing her nose a bit.
</p>
<a name="24187676" id="24187676"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24187676 </span></h3>
<p>Well, 'raised voices' wouldn't really cut it at this point, with the older girl pulling our girl's hair and giving her as hard a pinching as she could manage, while she got a chlorine-scented plastic hand shoved in her face, and a real one starting to dig a thumb into the soft bits between her collarbone and her neck. People were running (well, as best as you can on a wet pool deck) to try and break it up, but before they could reach the two of them, our girl gave the older one a pretty vicious (from onlooker's descriptions) shove to the solar plexus with her good hand, which sent her stumbling and slipping backward...and right into the pool at the edge.
</p><p>Unfortunately, she was still hanging onto her hair (which she tore a hookfull of out), and as it turned out, her swimsuit, so she got pulled in right along with her.
</p>
<a name="24188312" id="24188312"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24188312 </span></h3>
<p>Well, that tossed some cold water on the fight, to use a terrible metaphor, with both their nurses diving in to pull them out; the older girl was struggling but managing to keep her head above water, but ours was having more trouble, having the aforementioned trouble with doing the same. Fortunately, she got helped up to the surface before she was in any real danger, though she did cough up some water she'd sucked in before she got her bearings.
</p><p>The older girl was helped out first, standing up a bit dizzily...only to fall again, this time face-first onto the deck, when our girl grabbed one of her ankles and pulled. Well, at that point, they were quickly seperated, with the older girl crying and having bit her lip when she fell the second time, in addition to having scraped her knees, and a sullen claim of 'she started it' being the only excuse offered by ours.
</p>
<a name="24188768" id="24188768"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24188768 </span></h3>
<p>This being the second fight in as many months, she got more flack this time than the first, even if the other girl did start it (I believe her, even if I'm hardly the most impartial person), particularly for that last move, when the fight was already 'over'. She didn't see it that way, of course, as she pointed out to her rehab nurse, social worker, in-house shrink, and new specialist shrink, when they all grilled her on it, and tried to make it clear that it wasn't acceptable. They didn't make much headway; even if she said she knew it was 'wrong', she didn't say she felt bad about it, bruises or otherwise.
</p><p>Unlike the first incident, her social worker suggested that I have a talk with her about it and try to make the party line clear to her. I suppose it's a good thing, in a way, that I'm being included, whether it's just because of our relationship, or because I'm being viewed as being a definite part of her life in some way...well, it feels like a good thing, anyway.
</p>
<a name="24189215" id="24189215"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24189215 </span></h3>
<p>I'd heard most of the story from the resident shrinkette and my friend at the rehab center; the story from the other girl and onlookers, anyway. When I came into work that night, I heard her side, which I've already more or less relayed in previous posts. She was pretty tight-lipped about what set it all off, sticking to her 'mean' summation of what was said. Whether it was intentional cruelty, or the kinds of things kids say to each other, even if they're on the low end of the totem pole as well, I can't really say...I suppose it doesn't matter too much. I told her that she already knew it wasn't a good thing for her to get into fights, as we'd already talked about at least twice so far...and I know she knows it, even if she looked away rather than admitting it herself. I told her that I didn't want her to get into trouble, because she didn't deserve that...and it more or less wrapped up with a hug and a diversion into playing a game to try and forget about it for now.
</p>
<a name="24189520" id="24189520"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> 24189520 </span></h3>
<p>The thing I feel worst about in this whole incident is that she wound up fighting with another kid going through some of the same things she is, rather than them hitting it off...I mean, at this point, I'm more or less her only friend, and I'm quite aware that isn't a particularly healthy state of affairs for a child. Maybe a fight was deserved, maybe it wasn't, I don't know...still, I can't help but regret the outcome, you know? Life and human irrationality sucks sometimes, particularly when the people that need something the most can't help themselves from driving it away...ah, well...
</p><p>First story that sprang to mind, I'll try and think of another that might be interesting, but for now, I suppose I can switch to question/answer/random mode for now.

<p>Her rehab nurse suggested the possibility of some Aikido lessons, to help her practice her falling, and as a general 'thing to do'. It sounds like a good idea, really, since I know I'm inadequate to the task of giving her everything she needs outside of her bed, no matter how hard I try...I'm just not sure the world of Fools is ready for her to be able to flip people all over the place with her one good hand, you know? (And less jovially, even as peaceable as aikido seems, considering her aggressive tendencies, getting her involved in any fighting seems unwise somehow...)

<p>Really? I don't know (or pretend to know) much about martial arts, took a karate class for, like, two months back when I was in junior high, but that's about it. Would aikido be a good idea? I did some quick web-searches for local schools after the suggestion, though I suppose I don't really know enough to have made sense of what I found. Lots of them focused on being very kid-friendly, and non-fighting centered and such, which seemed nice, but most martial arts schools I've seen said stuff like that, really. And considering some of the dumbasses I've seen on the internets when martial arts come up, most of the ones that actually do it probably going to schools that also say the same thing, I had to wonder...

<dl><dd><i>Aikido emphasizes joining with an attack and redirecting the attacker's energy, as opposed to meeting force with force, and consists primarily of body throws and joint-locking techniques.
