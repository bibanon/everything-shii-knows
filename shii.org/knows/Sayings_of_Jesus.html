<dl><dd>Jesus said,
<dl><dd>Listen, a sower came forth, took a handful, and cast. Now, some fell upon the path, and the birds came and picked them out. Others fell upon rock, and they did not take root in the soil, and did not send up ears. And others fell upon the thorns, and they choked the seed; and the grubs devoured them.

<dl><dd>Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge. He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said: 
<dl><dd>"Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd>Then Jesus said,
<dl><dd>"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd>When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. He told them,
<dl><dd>"The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables so that,
<dl><dd>they may be ever seeing but never perceiving,
</dd><dd>and ever hearing but never understanding;
</dd><dd>otherwise they might turn and be forgiven! (Isaiah 6:9-10)
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd>Then Jesus said to them,
<dl><dd>"Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? The farmer sows the word. Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."

<a name="9.2B9.01_Mt" id="9.2B9.01_Mt"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">9+9.01 Mt</span></h3>
<dl><dd>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. Then he told them many things in parables, saying:
<dl><dd>"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. He who has ears, let him hear."
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd>The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?" He replied,
<dl><dd>"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. This is why I speak to them in parables:
<dl><dd>Though seeing, they do not see;
</dd><dd>though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd>In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:
<dl><dd>You will be ever hearing but never understanding;
</dd><dd>you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
</dd><dd>For this people's heart has become calloused;
</dd><dd>they hardly hear with their ears,
</dd><dd>and they have closed their eyes.
</dd><dd>Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
</dd><dd>hear with their ears,
</dd><dd>understand with their hearts
</dd><dd>and turn, and I would heal them. (Isaiah 6:9-10)
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd>But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
</dd><dd>"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown."

<dl><dd>After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.
</dd><dd>While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:
<dl><dd>"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up. Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown."
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd>When he said this, he called out,
<dl><dd>"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd>His disciples asked him what this parable meant. He said,
<dl><dd>"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,
<dl><dd>though seeing, they may not see;
</dd><dd>though hearing, they may not understand.' (Isaiah 6:9)
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd>"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>But why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do the things which I say?
</dd><dd>Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like:
</dd><dd>He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently against that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock.
</dd><dd>But he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream beat vehemently; and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.

</dd><dd>But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.
