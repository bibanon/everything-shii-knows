<dl><dd><i>This is my favorite part of my favorite book ever, so please read it closely.</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>Every day, more and more people took to saving time, and the more they did so the more they were copied by others--even by those who had no real desire to join in but felt obliged to.
</p><p>Radio, television  and  newspapers  daily advertised and  extolled  the
merits  of new, timesaving gadgets that would  one  day leave people free to
live the  'right' kind of  life. Walls  and  billboards were  plastered with
posters depicting scenes of happiness and prosperity.  Splashed  across them
in fluorescent lettering were slogans such as:
</p>
<center>TIMESAVERS ARE  GOING PLACES  FAST!
<p>THE FUTURE  BELONGS TO  TIMESAVERS!
</p>
MAKE MORE OF YOUR LIFE - SAVE TIME!</center>
<p>The real picture, however,  was very  different. Admittedly, timesavers
were  better dressed  than the people who lived near the  old  amphitheatre.
They  earned more money  and  had  more  to  spend,  but they looked  tired,
disgruntled and  sour, and  there was  an  unfriendly light  in their  eyes.
They'd  never heard the phrase "Why not go and  see Momo?" nor did they have
anyone  to  listen  to them in  a way  that  would  make them  reasonable or
conciliatory, let alone happy. Even had they known of such a person, they would have  been highly  unlikely to pay him or her a visit  unless the whole  affair could be  dealt with in five minutes flat, or they would  have
considered it a waste of time. In  their view, even leisure time had  to  be
used  to  the full, so  as  to  extract  the maximum  of  entertainment  and
relaxation with the minimum of delay.
</p><p>Whatever the  occasion, whether  solemn or joyous, time-savers could no
longer celebrate it properly. Daydreaming they regarded almost as a criminal
offence. What they could endure least of all, however, was silence, for when
silence fell they became terrified by the realization of what  was happening
to their lives. And  so, whenever silence threatened to descend, they made a
noise. It  wasn't a happy sound, of course, like the hubbub in a  children's
playground, but an angry, ill-tempered din that grew louder every day.
</p><p>It  had  ceased to matter that people  should enjoy their work and take
pride in it; on the contrary, enjoyment merely  slowed them  down. All  that
mattered  was  to  get  through  as much  work  as possible in the  shortest
possible time, so notices to that effect were prominently displayed in every
factory and office building. They read:
</p>
<center>     TIME IS PRECIOUS - DON'T WASTE IT! or:
     TIME IS MONEY - SAVE IT!</center>
<p>Similar   notices  hung   above   business  executives'  desks  and  in
boardrooms,  in doctors' consulting rooms, shops, restaurants and department
stores - even in schools and kindergartens. No one was left out.
</p><p>Last but  not least, the appearance of the city itself changed more and
more. Old buildings were pulled down and replaced with modern ones devoid of
all  the  things that were now thought superfluous. No architect troubled to
design houses that suited the people who were to live in them, because that would have meant building a whole range of different houses. It was far
cheaper and, above all, more timesaving to make them identical.
</p><p>Huge modern  housing  developments  sprang  up  on the  city's  northern
outskirts--endless rows of multi-storyed tenements as indistinguishable as
peas in  a pod.  And  because the buildings all looked alike, so, of course,
did  the streets. They grew steadily longer, stretching away to the  horizon
in  dead  straight  lines and  turning the  countryside  into a  disciplined
desert. The lives of the people who inhabited this desert followed a similar
pattern: they ran dead straight for as  far as the eye could see. Everything
in them was carefully planned and  programmed, down to the last move and the
last moment of time.
</p><p>People never seemed to  notice that, by saving time,  they  were losing
something else.  No one cared  to admit that  life was becoming ever poorer,
bleaker and more monotonous.
</p><p>The  ones who felt this  most keenly  were the children, because no one
had time for them any more.
</p><p>But time is  life  itself, and life resides in the human heart. And the
more people saved, the less they had.

<dl><dd><i>WARNING: SPOILERS! GO READ THE BOOK!</i>
</dd></dl>
<p><i>Momo</i> is a book of little symbolism but many powerful themes. Ende makes direct statements about <a href="Listening.html" title="Listening">listening</a>, <a href="Time.html" title="Time">time</a>, and the music of the spheres. For the first two subjects, <i>Momo</i> was the first time I had ever seen these  things described with the appreciation they deserve.
</p><p>Eventually I'll list all of the major things here.
</p><p><i>I haven't written all the sections on this page yet. I intend to finish it later.</i>
</p>
<a name="The_hour-lilies" id="The_hour-lilies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The hour-lilies</span></h3>
<p>Also known as the "flowers of hours." Actually I made that up just now. The hour-lilies are both ineffable and irreplaceable, and yet, like time, they disappear from us just as soon as we see them. The use of a flower for this image cannot be explained beyond its real beauty.
</p><p>Towards the end of the book, Momo takes an hour-lily with her and saves the world in but an hour. Does she do this by "saving time," putting less effort into her actions than she ought to so that there will be more time later? No, she just does what she has to do.
</p>
<a name="The_toys" id="The_toys"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The toys</span></h3>
<p>The expensive electric toys in Momo are first and foremost a real criticism of children's toys today, which are stand-ins for conscious thought. No wonder kids are buying video game systems instead of talking action figures! The small amount of laziness made possibly by toys that repeat themselves can't hold up to the new level of laziness made possible by transistors that imagine <i>everything</i> for you.
</p><p>But elements of the stupidity of these toys can also be seen in things that are not children's toys. Take for example the talking doll which the grey gentlemen plant for Momo. Its chatter seems like a silly exaggeration, but aren't there many things in your life that act like that doll? Our computers are programmed to whine at us about the things that they want us to spend money on-- the registered version that will make our lives better, the full antivirus solution that will keep us secure. Our iPods demand us to fill them up with songs. I'm being rhetorical, I don't own an iPod. But an iPod is sort of an expensive, unimaginative toy, isn't it? Designed for nothing but entertainment, it fills your ears with song for you, until you go through all the songs in your library.
</p>
<a name="The_movie" id="The_movie"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The movie</span></h2>
<p>I watched the movie without subtitles. It was a closer adaption to the book than <i>The Neverending Random Plot Event Movie</i>, and used nearly the exact dialogue and series of events, but the effects left a lot to be desired. Also, Momo is the kind of book where you like to imagine your own designs for the characters. For example, I definitely did not imagine Momo with an afro.
</p>
<a name="Reviews" id="Reviews"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reviews</span></h2>
<p>Momo is a beloved classic around the world, except in the <a href="United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>. For bubu of iitran, it was his inspiration in childhood. It's also required reading for one of my college's German literature classes. I don't know the teacher who did that but I love her already.
</p><p>What WAHa.06x36 of iitran thought of Momo:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Shii&gt; hey, why is it that you like the neverending story better?
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; Shii: well.
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; Shii: I like Momo because it is subversive.
&lt;Shii&gt; i mean, any story with self-references is one of the best of all time by default, but... it seems a
pretty basic fairy tale
&lt;Shii&gt; ("if on a winter's night a traveller" is pretty good)
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; Shii: but with <a href="The_Neverending_Story.html" title="The Neverending Story">the Neverending Story</a>, well, first of all, I like fairy tales.
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; and Neverending Story has a lot of specific elements I like a lot.
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; it also has a deep humanism and insight that is lacking from nearly all fantasy literature ever.
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; pretty much every character in the neverending story is, at some level, likeable, even the
scariest monster.
&lt;dmpk2k|w_&gt; Neverending Story? Wait, is that the one with the film? &gt;.&gt;;;;
&lt;Shii&gt; you mean... modern fantasy literature... that makes a lot of sense
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; Shii: right.
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; Shii: and Momo, for all its other values, is still a tale of some sort of good versus some sort
of \evil. 
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; and I don't care much for that.
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; neverending story is much more nuanced.
&lt;Shii&gt; yeah, if i could reframe the idealistic morals of the one in the realistic universe of the other...
well  it'd take a genius author to do that 
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; and also the neverending story just has SO MUCH STUFF in it.
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; the huge cast of characters, the settings, the imagery is wonderful...
&lt;WAHa_06x36&gt; that forest of light has haunted me ever since I first read it, a long time ago.
