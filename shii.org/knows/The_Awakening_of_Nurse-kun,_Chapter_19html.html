<p>Hey, /b/. It's been a while, I know, but I thought I'd give this another shot, since things have calmed down slightly as of late in my personal life, and I did say I might be back in a month or so in my last post...which I just remembered a few days ago. I wasn't very thrilled to get accused of being an imposter of...myself, my writing style that day apparently being sub-par and 'not like the real Nurse-kun's'. Well, a friend of mine told me that he dropped in to let you know that I was having some trouble at the time that was weighing heavily, and I figured, fuck it, I might as well just tell you, though I'm not looking for attention via doing so, merely offering it as an explanation.
</p><p>You can judge for yourselves then, though I can't say I'm overly inspired at this point.
</p><p>(As a side note, the picture I'm posting with this is beautiful, and to whoever did it: You touched me when I saw it.)

<p>My father has cancer. Pancreatic cancer, which they've caught too late to have much chance of 'curing'. He had an attack of pain so severe that it left him curled up in a fetal position on the kitchen floor in the house I grew up in, and this man, that I've never seen make so much as a sound in my life when he's been hurt, couldn't keep from screaming. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance against his own urgings, and within twelve hours, they had the diagnosis. I took the night off work when I heard about this, and was there when the doctor gave his results. That was two days before the last time I posted, wherein I was trying to relate the story of our trip to the zoo, on the previous friday, before the incident.
</p><p>I may not be an oncologist, but I've worked with enough patients in various areas of our system to know what a late-caught pancreatic cancer diagnosis means. I suppose I shouldn't have posted at the time, should've taken some more time off before doing so, but I actually thought to myself: 'Hey, maybe it'll cheer me up a little.'. Shows just how messed up this little affair has left me, to think this about /b/, huh?

<a name="23586994" id="23586994"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23586994</span></h3>
<p>Anyway, after I said 'fuck this shit' and left, my life went on. I began a new juggling act, between my girl and my father, with her social worker, after the third outing, to a hockey game, actually, giving her approval to me as a 'mentor', thus ending the chaperoning. So for the past four weeks or so, I've averaged three or four afternoons a week with him and my mom (he's gotten pretty sick of us 'hovering' at this point, but she seems to need it), and two or so with her. This hasn't left a lot of time for even the wreck of a social life I had before, but while I can say 'fuck this' to you guys, saying it to them is just a bit harder.
</p>
<a name="23587323" id="23587323"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23587323</span></h3>
<p>But I'll tell you a story now, first, just to get the personal 'whoring' out of the way. After all, I'm quite aware of what those of you that are interested in this at all are here for.
</p><p>About a week after my father's initial hospitalization, when I was at work, and somewhat distractedly playing a game of chess with her, she was quiet for a long while, until the game was nearly over, then looked up at me, and asked me what was wrong. I was somewhat surprised, and snapped out of my own thoughts, which had indeed been centered on my family's 'problem'. I'd been nearly as out of it with her as I had been on here, and she'd clearly noticed, but not said anything until then.
</p>
<a name="23587784" id="23587784"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23587784</span></h3>
<p>I finally told her, after hesitating and thinking about it for a good minute or so, just what was happening. She listened quietly, not interrupting, as I related the details, and when I was finished, and I looked down quietly, feeling bad now that I'd layed that on her, which I certainly wouldn't do with a 'normal' girl her age, she proceeded to move her bishop, and say "Checkmate".
</p><p>I couldn't help but laugh, after a few seconds. As she watched me, rubbing my eyes as I did so, I caught a hint of a smile, a grin, even, though it was as fleeting as a spring breeze. Once I'd gotten it out of my system and congratulated her on beating me, as usual, she surprised me again, by quietly saying, "Sorry.". She clarified, a moment later, that she meant about 'my dad', and then she seemed to be the one hesitating, before speaking in a bit of a rush, telling me: "...it's...hard.".
</p>
<a name="23588139" id="23588139"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23588139</span></h3>
<p>Whatever pain and regret I'd been feeling, both for myself and for involving her in it, magnified themselves as she said that in a near-whisper, staring down at my captured king in her hand, resting in her lap. I set the board aside and moved from my chair to sit on the edge of her bed, and tentatively put an arm around her shoulders, as she squeezed her eyes shut. I told her that I was sorry, that I shouldn't have dragged her into my own problems, my voice faltering a bit as I saw that she was fighting to hold back tears then, and dropped the chess piece to hold her hand over her eyes, as if to hide them.
</p><p>Feeling like a real piece of shit, I stroked her hair, and apologized again, then thanked her for her sympathy, telling her she'd helped me feel better for it; the fact that I now felt even worse than before was no obstacle to my saying so. Then she said something that I haven't been able to forget since.
</p>
<a name="23588909" id="23588909"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23588909</span></h3>
<p>"I hate that girl in Elite Beat Agents. Real life isn't like that.". I'd known pretty much from the start that that stage in that game wasn't going to go over well, and while she didn't play it when we were together, and had said in the past that she 'didn't like it', it'd been a somewhat low-key do not want. I wasn't really sure what the right response would be, but after she lapsed into silence, I had to try something, so I eventually simply nodded slightly, and said 'No, it isn't.'. I mean, sure, the rest of the game is ridiculous as well, but this was hardly the time for a smart-assed response.
</p><p>Then, after a moment more of silence, she spoke up again, voice hauntingly painful: "...people just go away. Forever.". And despite her delivery, her previous composure, as she finished the final syllable in that word, her vocie quavered, and she started crying. Not having anything to say that could fix that, I just held her, and did my best not to make things any worse.

<p>Not much else happened that night...she eventually settled down a bit, and I helped dry her eyes and cheeks, and told her, with as much sincerity and honesty as I could summon forth, that she was the most special girl I knew, and that I really did feel better now. She fell asleep a few minutes later, clutching my hand as tightly as she ever had outside of a nightmare incident, and as I sat there with her for a while longer, I have to admit...I did feel better, for all the pain the whole thing stirred up.

<p>I made a formal application for adoption within the week. I don't know...maybe the combination of this event and her words made it clear to me that life is short, and sitting on the sidelines just gives you a good view while it passes you by. When I took her, for one of our outings, back to my family home, at her request and my mother's approval, it certainly seemed crystallized for me, as I watched her, sitting in her chair in the living room beside my father, half-asleep due to the painkillers, in his recliner, reach out and rest her little hand on top of his big, work-worn one...I can't really say with any surety.
</p><p>All I can say is that I know I'm doing the right thing. And I'll see it through, no matter what it might cost me.

<p>Thus far, she hasn't really recieved any schooling since she's been at the home...really heartening to see the system working, yeah. If it works out, I'd probably be homeschooling her until she's got the rehab down to an art, since she's made it clear she still hates the chair, and if she could walk, even with some help from me, we wouldn't be using it on our outings. Since her mental faculties are unharmed, she'd likely not need a 'special needs' school, though she's still got a long way to go in dealing with her trauma, so she probably wouldn't be the perfect boring student. It's something we'll need to face when we face it.

<p>Not much has changed with regard to the rest of the staff, the resident shrinkette, her rehab nurses. She's started seeing a specialist in childhood psychiatric trauma at the children's hospital once a week, but she's still distant and reserved with her, too. The rest of the residents/patients and her rehab peers have been generally avoided as usual, but not fought with, so that's something...though a small stuffed lion was thrown at the head of an obnoxious brat at the zoo, who ran wailing to her parents, who had little sympathy once they heard what she'd said out of their earshot. The lion was retrieved and dusted off, and no blood was spilled...this time.
</p><p>The incident with my dad...I think he was too out of it to really acknowledge it, or likely even remember it, but my mom saw it from the kitchen, along with me. We didn't mention that we'd seen it to her, didn't want to embarass her or something...but I'm pretty sure my mom was really touched by me...as was I, of course. While we were there, she was on the best behaviour I've seen thus far, and while not really friendly as such, as not-unfriendly as I've seen her, too. So that was nice...

</dd></dl>
<p>Her father was a first-generation Scandanavian-American, full-out blonde hair and, actually, blue eyes, pale (but tannable) skin, tall stature, etc. Her mother was fourth or fifth-generation Japanese-American. Seems the dice rolled such that she got much of his colouring, with a mix of their facial traits and such. It's an interesting combination, I can't really describe it that well, not being an artist, but she's got a roughly even blend of caucasian and japanese features, small but not puggish button nose, good cheekbones, eyes are somewhere in-betweenish, strong but not pronounced chin, etc...kind of a cross between a really cute japanese girl and a really cute nordic-type girl. And I think she's very cute, though I suppose that's subjective for some people. And yes, her eyes are green, and her hair is an ashy blonde...it's not barbie or raincoat yellow, but it is blonde.
</p><p>I'm not a geneticist, but I know I've seen pictures of other half-japanese people that turned out natural blonde and blue/green eyed before, so I hardly think it's THAT bizarre.

<p>I'm not entirely sure about her whole family history. I know her mom was a fourth/fifth generation Japanese-American, I'm not sure what may have happened in either sides of her family stretching back in the 70+ years before now. I saw a picture and she looked pretty Japanese to me, (and pretty pretty, too, though I kind of feel bad saying so, still, she was), but I'm not an expert in picking up heritage through traits and such.

<p>The elbow, wrist aand fingers are all pretty necessary to play the instruments she knows, or most instruments, even. I mean, wasn't Def Leppard's one-armed drummer a below-elbow amputee, even? As it stands the current generation just doesn't have the speed or dexterity to handle musical performances beyond, like, kindergarten stuff, which she was somewhat beyond already. Even with some piano pieces written specifically for a pianist with just his left hand after WWI (I think) would still require foot pedals, I think, so even there she's kind of screwed...it's not very good, as it stands. Synthesizers and electronic stuff seems like her best choices for right here and now, and she's refused to try it when I've offered to get some software on my laptop and smuggle it in for her to try out, so...

</p><p>She was pretty supportive, even as she was honest about how difficult it'd still be; even so, she said that his condition probably wouldn't negatively affect my chances, anyway...and might make it more clear to the people that decide these things why I'd do so.

</dd><dd><i>"Okay, so there’s a book called City Limits. It’s a compilation work, with a few different people with stuff in the book. What’s my submission? A story about an armless, legless, mentally disturbed loli hospital shut-in. I am not even kidding. It’s the perfect wrist-cutting bastard spawn of Nana and PXI."</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>Well, that's kind of disturbing.

<p>Thank you for being there to support me. Without people like you, I may have given up on what seemed like a hopelessly doomed notion. For every anonymous that says I'm their inspiration, I can just hold up a mirror. That goes for all of you.

<p>Well, I do have to leave for work in an hour and a half or so. And since I'll be with her, I'd have to defend her even against 4chan, were a bunch of you to show up in green ski masks and try to 'raid' her.

<p>Man, this may make me seem unAmerican, but *I* don't know how to handle a gun. Dad was always very much opposed to it.

<p>On a 'posting day', I generally get home from work in the morning, sleep for six to eight hours, wind up posting in one of these threads for most of the day, then go to work. Like I said earlier, it's a wreck of a social life at best, practically a second job already.

<dl><dd><i>Nurse-kun, tell us about what's been going on with you and Amputee-chan, your adoption conversation aside.</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>Well, a fair amount of things have happened...I'm not sure I have the time or the energy to really get into them right now, though, particularly as I'm making a late dinner and getting ready for work.
</p>
<a name="23613961" id="23613961"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23613961</span></h3>
<p>She's improved in some areas, and not as much in others. The car ride to the zoo, for example, was nearly identical to the downtown core the previous time. It may have been slightly 'better' for her because the previous one was her longest trip since the accident, but I can't say I really noticed a major difference...she kept her iPod on loud enough that I could make out words from my spot beside her, and that was over the noise of the engine and traffic, which were not inconsiderable.
</p>
<a name="23614398" id="23614398"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23614398</span></h3>
<p>She's still having the nightmares...it's just that after the first few descriptions, there didn't seem to be much more I could say without sounding like I was tugging at heartstrings and copypasta-ing myself. It's almost disturbing how similar they are; she relives the crash and the subsequent entombment in the car with her dead parents, then the firefighters and paramedics showing up and cutting her out of it, then the trip to the hospital, and her experience in the ER...
</p><p>...she remembers EVERYTHING. Every time. Unless she breaks out of it herself and manages to wake up, or I'm close enough to hear her whimpering and talking in her sleep (which sometimes turn into screaming), and I wake her up. Then I sit with her, and hold her, and do my best to comfort her, and help her calm down, and dry her eyes...
</p><p>This is still happening an average of three times a week, sometimes as much as five, used to average five and sometimes happen every night in the hospital post-accident.
</p>
<a name="23614922" id="23614922"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23614922</span></h3>
<p>I don't discuss them much anymore because I don't like thinking about them, and about what she's going through. I had nightmares for a while myself as a child, though nothing like this, and thinking about her...well.
</p><p>She's still roughly as prone to PTSD 'attacks' as before, mostly when she gets stressed out, when she's exposed to things that bother her...she'd start freaking out when she needed an MRI in the hospital, and even being in her washroom makes her visibly tense. Our resident shrink reports not much progress with her new specialist at the children's hospital (another longer car-ride a week, which she isn't too happy about), but it may simply be an issue of trust, as well.
</p>
<a name="23615768" id="23615768"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23615768</span></h3>
<p>She's still working hard at her physical rehabilitation...and making more progress, even slow as it is, than on the other fronts. She's now making it halfway down the parallel bars walk of glory on her own just about every session, and can make it there and back again without a major stumble with a nurse's help, most days. Of course, she needs to rest and recover afterward. Unfortunately, her phantom pain is still as bad as ever, and it often acts up after a rigorous session.
</p><p>She's working hard with her arm and hand as well, and making progress in coordinating the use of her elbow, wrist, and grip...nearly as quickly as any patient she's had before, her primary nurse there says. Her use of her left hand has just kept improving as well...considerably faster than mine has, as I provide less and less challenge to her at EBA and Ouendan.
</p>
<a name="23616096" id="23616096"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">23616096</span></h3>
<p>Basically, she's trying her best with what she's capable of changing, and trying to accept and deal with what she can't...though I don't think she'd much care for being compared to a religious prayer. She continues to be awesome.

<dl><dd><i>[Wild suggestions regarding some sort of lucid dream training.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>Um, yeah, I'm not an expert, or even particularly knowledgable in the human mind. Pretending otherwise doesn't seem to be a particularly wise thing at this juncture, nor does trying to 'fix' her on my own...which I know I can't do.

<dl><dd><i>[More suggestions about learning to interrupt bad dreams by oneself]</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>Well, our resident shrink has tried to work with her on the nightmares, and I'd imagine that her new specialist will be as well...my trying to 'help out' could be like a complete retard trying to 'help out' with inserting a catheter. It may sound simple, but you don't want to see what happens when it goes wrong.

<p>Well, I'm not quite sure about that just yet...she's getting really good, but I'm not a complete fool when it comes to using a stylus to save the world.
