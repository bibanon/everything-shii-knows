<p>Hey, /v/. I have a question, if it isn't too much trouble for you. With pokemon pearl (or diamond, I guess), when one exchanges friend codes, does one give up personal or IP information of some sort? And, more importantly, what are the capacities for communication over wireless and such? Can one send text messages, or things like that, or is it limited to non-personalized battling and trading and such?
</p><p>See, I'm considering whether it's wise to solicit said codes for wireless play for a certain someone, or...not so much.
</p><p>Picture not entirely related, but /v/ish.

</dd><dd> <i>tl;dr: what &gt;&gt;3752743 said</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>Yes, but what about the communication issue? Just what can one do to communicate with someone you have a friend code with? I can't check the manual and such, because it's still in the box, which is still in the store, on hold for me.

<p>Okay, another question...if you had the opportunity, would you play some pokeymans with her? I can't really say how she'd 'behave' on it, but she's certainly a lot more tolerable to me than any other kid her age I've spent time with...but I suppose I'm a bit biased.

</dd></dl>
<p>Yes, she has one arm, one eye, and she's missing her legs above the knee; a result of which, along with the orphaning due to her parents dying in the crash that inflicted said injuries, she's living in a nursing home, surrounded by old people and professional caregivers, as a ward of the state.
</p><p>As such, she doesn't really get out much, or get to play or interact with people her own age, which is why I'm considering any of this at all.

<p>Well...she was quite handy with the internets, apparently, before the accident, and losing her home/room/own PC/internet access/etc. And with young and intelligent parents, I'm fairly sure, as she's told me herself, that they taught her how to be careful on it. So she isn't an entirely wideeyed Amish kid exposed to the online abyss for the first time.
</p><p>Still, if it's limited to seeing Seakings named 'Fuck Yeah', that'd be acceptable. It isn't as if she hasn't heard such words before, after all.

<p>That sort of thing would be what I'm worried about...well, not <b>wikichan</b>, really, since her only form of internet access is her DS, and she doesn't have the web browser thing I think I saw somewhere once, but problematic mails through trades and such in general, ranging a gamut of various subjects. My best idea is to ask her to let me read them first when she gets one, since she knows how people can behave online, though I'm not sure the game supports that, or such. Been a while since I played one, and not the new version yet.

<p>Hi. Cheer up, you guys, it's a beautiful day where I am...and dwelling on the dark won't accomplish anything. I know that, despite my frequent jokes (well, partial jokes) about the toxicity of 4chan, there are probably at least a few people on here that actually care about her. Which is why I'm asking this here, and considering the possibility of trying to find some of those people for friend codes, at all.
</p><p>People are always saying that I 'restore their faith in humanity' or 'inspire them to do more with their lives' or such, which is hard for me to believe, because I'm just, you know, a guy. But the truth is, a lot of you have given me a new way of looking at Anonymous, as well. Hm, tired, sentimental.

<p>Hey, /b/. Okay, so, she was playing her new copy of Pokemon: Pearl for the DS when I saw her again last night. After filling me in on what'd happened in the game since I last saw her, and commenting on how stupid she thought Team Galaxy's haircuts were, she lapsed into a somewhat more depressed mood, then looked down and said, "I'm such a loser. I can't even play with other people when they build a wireless mode into it.".
</p><p>Which, naturally, made me feel bad for multiple reasons. Bad enough that I told her I could probably find some people that wanted to play with her on the internet, the only problem being that they were strangers, and that I knew she already knew about strangers on the internet (from her pre-accident days of using it under the supervision of her parents). Still...it had me wondering if the rewards may outweigh the risks. What do you think?

<p>That was the plan, if it seemed at all feasible on other fronts. I wasn't planning to ID her as, well, who she is. The big issue is the voice chat, and the sort of messages and text communication one can engage in over wifi.

<p>For the record. She was using the internet a fair amount before the accident, as makes sense for an intelligent young girl from an intelligent young family of professionals. The parents making up the rest of said family having educated her on the perils of the internets, and how to remain safe from said perils whilst surfing the highway, to mix metaphors. She already knows there are 'bad people' out there, as we (she and I) have in fact discussed, when I told her there was a possibility of getting friends codes from said internets. She isn't a wideeyed retarded naif from Amish country, nor a sheltered mystic named after a precious stone, people, even if she is still a child, and thus not nearly fully aware of precisely what constitutes the 'bad stuff' people can do.Just for the record.

<p>Oh, and to follow this up: Since the only computer access available in the facility is for the staff, at workstations and in offices (the policy is not so up to date as to provide internet access to the old people in our place, no siree), her DS is still pretty much her only internets-capable device available to her (possibly to any patient).

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <i>Bud if I had pokemon (and a DS), I'd sure be up for playing her. Alas, I don't have either, except for an old version of Blue and Red and my old GB color. *sigh* That said, it would probably be unwise to give out her friend code or whatever (forgive me for not knowing how it works, like I said I don't have a DS), too many immature /b/tards in the masses, I'm afraid. You dont want to risk anything, not just for you being found out, but for her own sake. With her sensitive nature and overall <b>damaged</b> mental state (hope that term doesnt offend you, but i cant really describe it otherwise), you dont want to risk someone saying something to here, text message or otherwise, that would hurt her. I mean, with the idiots in /b/, I'm sure half the people would want to say something along the lines of "SUCK MY COCK BITCH". Don't risk it.</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <i>Few questions for you if you have the time pal:</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <i>1. Kind of relating to the thread, but how has Amputan been doing as far as being more open around you and others? I'm sure you two are progressing, but it sure as hell would be sad if she keeps herself closed off from her emotions. From what I have read on the wiki, she even has a hard time looking you in the eyes when she is talking about something emotional. Poor girl.</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <i>Question 2: How's she feeling now? Last I checked, she chilled at your place for some R&amp;R. It's nice that they allowed you to do that.</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <i>Question 3: Any chance you can post the recipe of the soup? I can go for some right now, if I dont seriously fuck it up with my horrible cooking skills.</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <i>Last Question: Any updates on the adoption process? Has she ever mentioned she would want to go to your place again for a while, to get out of the home or whatnot?Epic thread. Best of luck to both you, its real nice you take such good care of her. The girl needs it.*commence "gtfo emofag" posts from the trolls.</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>1) Still <b>damaged</b>. I can only accept it, try to be understanding, and attempt to help with her repairs.
</p><p>2) She's all better, and back to her chipper, energetic, non-coughing and queasy self. I'm glad it worked out all right on the SW and administration side as well.
</p><p>3) I'm sorry, I don't have it on me, as it's my mom's recipe and she hasn't taught it to me yet (just my sisters). I'll try and get ahold of it, though.
</p><p>Still ongoing, no change from my last thread-time. We went on a picnic on wednesday, and I'm considering something for either tomorrow or monday, depending on scheduling, weather, difficulties with my dad, etc. Nothing about my place in particular, other than telling me I should dust more.

<p>Hmm...that's very interesting. So, what I've come to thus far as far as conclusions go: Anyone having her friend code is useless unless she has theirs and adds it to her list or something. I assume one can remove friend codes, and thus access, as well?
