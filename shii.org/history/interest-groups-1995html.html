SRI.COM:[ANONYMOUS.NETINFO]INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT                 [2/12/95]

Welcome to the "List of lists." This is a listing of special interest
group mailing lists available on the Internet.  It was started by Rich
Zellich back when there was only an Arpanet, and is probably the oldest
of the various "list of lists" available around the Internet.  

This compilation is copyrighted 1994, 1995 by Vivian Neou 
(vivian@sri.com). You are welcome to copy it to look at it online, but
it may not be reproduced in any other form without written permission
from me.  This file is available via anonymous FTP on sri.com in the
NETINFO directory in the file INTEREST-GROUPS.  It may also be obtained
through e-mail by sending a message to mail-server@sri.com with "send
interest-groups" in the body of the message.

**********************************************************************
I am looking for a few sites to list as official distribution points.
If you store a copy of this list in a public area and are willing to
have your site listed here please let me know. 
**********************************************************************

Official distribution locations:
    cu.nih.gov:network/interest.groups
    sri.com:[anonymous.netinfo]interest-groups.txt ** going away **

If you are putting up a copy of this list in a public place, please let
me know so that I can let you know when new versions come out. If you
see an old version of this list in a public repository on the net,
please let me (or the owner of the repository) know. 

I don't produce a list of incremental changes to this list - you have to
get the whole list.  If you want to receive notices of new lists as they
are created, check out the "NEW-LIST" list.  I don't have time to
respond to requests for searches for lists on specific topics - you'll
have to pull the list and search it yourself (which you've probably
already done if you're reading this). 

Since this is supposed to be a list of Internet lists, I'm trying to
translate all of the BITNET addresses into direct Internet addresses. If
you see one that I've missed, and know the correct address please let me
know.  If you are looking for a summary of BITNET lists, send a message to
LISTSERV@BITNIC.EDUCOM.EDU with "list global" in the message body.

If you find errors in the entries in this list, please let me know
(especially if you find a listing for a defunct list). 

To submit updates for the description of an existing mailing-lists or
to add a new listing, send a message to vivian@sri.com.  Listings
should include the following information:

        List Address:
        Subscription Address:
        List Management: (Majordomo, Listserv, Manual, etc)
        Owner:
        Description:
        Archive location and availability:
        How to join:
        List Traffic: (eg: around 3 messages/day)

List owners: If you are sending in information about a list that has
been around for awhile, please include information about the amount of
traffic that the list gets. If you are starting a list, please send this
information in (if you think of it) after the list has been around for a
couple months. 

*** IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT ***
*
* For administrative requests about a list (like getting added or deleted,
* asking about archive files, etc.) you write to the address listed under
* "Subscription Address" *NOT* the "List Address".  This gets you to the
* list owner or an automated list processor, rather than to the membership
* of the entire mailing list. If you goof and send an administrative
* message to the entire mailing list you will probably get blasted by
* irate list members. Save everyone grief by using the subscription
* address for adminitrative requests!
*
*** IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT ***

If the subscription address is a LISTSERV, send a message with
"subscribe listname" in the BODY of the message to the subscription
address.  Some List Addresses do not look like a regular Internet e-mail
address.  In general, these are LISTSERV lists. To send a message to the
list, look at the Subscription Address, and use that hostname along with
the list name to send a message to the list. For example, to send a
message to a list with a List Address called MYLIST with a Subscription
Address of LISTSERV@MYDOMAIN.COM, send your message to
MYLIST@MYDOMAIN.COM. Unix-based listservers usually require you to
include your name in the subscription request, so the command in your
request should be of the form "subscribe listname firstname lastname".
Most automated list servers will send back an explanation of the correct
command structure if you happen to get it wrong in your request. 

If the subscription address is MAILBASE, send a message with "join
listname FirstName LastName" in the body of the message to the
subscription address. 

How lists get on this list
--------------------------
There are a number of ways that lists get added to this list: I watch
the announcements on NEW-LIST, list owners (or interested members) send
me information, and I spend time (when I have it) looking around the net
for interesting lists. I do this so that the book that is based on this
list will have up-to-date information, and I make this list freely
available on the Internet because I'm a nice person :). Just in case you
are wondering why you should buy the book if you can get the online list
at no cost I'll tell you: the book is fully indexed, and descriptions
are listed by subject rather than by listname; it comes with a complete
description of list management software (vs the two paragraphs I've
included in this file); it comes with software that will automatically
subscribe and unsubscribe you from lists; and most importantly :)
royalties from the book pay for the time that I spend updating this
file.  The book will be coming out later this year (watch here for more
information). 

If you're anxious to buy a book now, you can get a hardcopy, indexed
version of the June, 1993 edition of this list under the title
"Internet: Mailing Lists".  The ISBN number for this book is
0-13-289661-3.  It is available in many bookstores, and may be ordered
directly from Prentice Hall by calling 515-284-6751. One note of
warning: the lists in this book are sorted alphabetically rather than by
subject as they are in the new book.

   a forum to discuss the current state of the art and future direction of
   alternative energy sources that are renewable and sustainable.  It is
   not intended to discuss either AE appropriateness or comparisons with

   An alternative energy source is taken to include solar, wind,
   geothermal, tidal, electro-chemical, hydro-electric, or any renewable
   and sustainable energy source.  It is also assumed to exclude fuels such
   as fossil and nuclear since these literally take an act of God to
   create.

   for developers that use Authorware Professional, the dual platform
   (Macintosh and MS-Windows) authoring program from MacroMedia. 
   Currently there are around 500 people subscribed. All mailings to 
   this list are archived (since April '94).
   This list is maintained by two individuals who have nothing to
   do with MacroMedia other than that they use Authorware Pro.
   The AWARE list has got a bi-directional link with the Newsgroup: 
   bit.listserv.authorware. Everything sent to the list goes to the 
   newsgroup, and everything sent to the newsgroup goes to the list.
   The (very friendly and readable) welcome message you get when 
   you subscribe gives a lot of information on FTP-sites and other
   related lists. The list gets between 10-20 messages/day.

   enable access to such data and information; and facilitate the
   use and exchange of and collaborative discussions about the
   information in order to meet the needs of public and private
   customers for conservation, sustainable use, education, and
   scientific inquiry.  Contributions and discussions in this
   list may help to shape the final proposal for the Center. This
   list is unmoderated. This list may be of interest to those
   with a general interest in biodiversity information sources
   and tools. New subscribers from any sector are welcome.
   Readers can find a straw description of the Center concept in
   the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's gopher,
   nmnhgoph.si.edu, under Biodiversity Programs.  Replies to
   posted messages go to the entire list.

  Description:
   Blister stands for Book LISTs with ER tacked on for mnemonic purposes.
   This  list is a place to send lists of books, not to discuss books. The 
   idea behind this list is that you get a list of every book you've read, 
   categorize the books into groups that you like and dislike, post the list.
   Feel free to make up categories. The point is that from time to time you'll
   see a list from someone who seems to have similar tastes to yours, and 
   hopefully there will be a whole slew of books that person loved that you
   haven't read. Bear in mind that very few people have taste as good as you do.
   Most of the lists will be from people whose taste is inferior to yours. Their
   lists are potentially very, very long. Just delete those letters. Don't bother
   trying to reeducate cretins. They don't know good literature when they see it
   and can't be taught.

  Description:
   The child-free mailing list provides information, discussion and a
   supportive environment for people who choose, are in the process of
   choosing, or have been been forced to remain, for various reasons,
   child-free.  This is not a mailing list for for anyone trying to bash
   the childless state; here, being childless is not something that has to
   be defended.  The list welcomes those searching for the answer to child-free
   versus children, but note that the emphasis of this list stays on the
   child-free state as being accepted and good.  Not everyone on the list
   is 100% pro-child-free, but all have valuable insights and ideas about
   what being childless has meant in their lives, and all are accepting of
   the childless state as a good and valuable lifestyle choice.  Abuse of
   this list is not tolerated.
   
   Typical discussions include fighting with internal voices about "the
   natural order of things", dealing with the misconception about not
   being a REAL woman if you don't want to have a child, battling family
   expectations and societial pressures such as giving our parents
   grandchildren, and the prejudices, questions, and general nosiness that
   we who remain child-free have to face in this kids-oriented society.
   We also discuss what we may face in maintaining relationships with our
   friends who have children, or who go from being child-free to having
   kids while we're friends.
   
   To reach a genuine human being, for help with problems encountered when
   using this list, send mail to owner-childfree@lunch.asd.sgi.com.

  Description:
   CHPOEM-L is an electronic mailing list devoted to sharing and
   discussing Chinese poems.
   For detailed conventions used for the list and technical info
   of Chinese computing, please FTP the CHPOEM-L Information File
   from ahkcus.org -192.55.187.25- in the directory ./gb/poem.
   Chinese files sent to the list should be uuencoded.  The uuencode
   command is included on most Unix-based systems; type "man uuencode"
   for instructions on its use, or ask your system administrator.  PC
   versions of uuencode and uudecode are available via anonymous ftp
   from ahkcus.org [192.55.187.25] as uuduue20.zip in the src/pc
   directory.  (Ask your system administrator for help using FTP.)  For
   information about uuencode and the Mac, see the Mac help file
   mentioned below.
   To read a file written in Chinese, you will need a program that can
   interpret the Chinese code used in that file.  Different programs are
   available for different hardware platforms.
   PC users can get information about GuoBiao editors by sending email 
   to LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the message GET PC HELP.  HKU Big5 files
   can be viewed with shownews.exe or readnews.exe, available via
   anonymous ftp at ahkcus.org [192.55.187.25] in the src/pc/hku
   directory.  (You will also need the chinese.16 font file from the
   same directory.)  ET Big5 files must be read with the ETen operating
   system, which is commercial software selling for about US$80.
   However there is a utility, et2hku, to convert ET Big5 files to HKU
   Big5 files, which can then be read with shownews.  
   Mac users can get information about both GuoBiao and Big5 software by
   sending email to LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the message GET MAC HELP.
   
   X Windows users can use either cxterm or xhzview for both GuoBiao
   or Big5 files.  For information about cxterm, send email to
   LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the message GET CXTERM HELP.  For infor-
   mation about xhzview, send email to LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the
   message GET XHZVIEW HELP.
   
   To convert between GuoBiao and Big5 (et or hku) files, use hc ("Hanzi
   Converter"), available via anonymous ftp from ahkcus.org [192.55.187.25]
   in the src/unix directory.  (There is another conversion utility
   available called b2g, but it seems to miss a large number of
   characters.)  Since Big5 covers about 5,000 more characters than
   GuoBiao, it's likely there will be a few missing characters in Big5
   to GuoBiao conversions.
   
   To convert between ET Big5 and HKU Big5, use et2hku, available via
   anonymous ftp from cs.purdue.edu [128.10.2.1] in the pub/ygz/utils
   directory.

   CompuMed is a moderated discussion group dealing with high
   performance computing and its implementation in the medical
   profession.  It includes archives of documents dealing with various
   supercomputer applications and work station standards for developing
   databases, medical curricula for allied health students, medical
   schools and practising physicians, and the use of virtual reality in
   developing tools for training medical students and presenting
   materials for disability networks like EASI.  Resource files indexing
   material currently available in databases for consultative use in the
   medical profession (this material would be suitable for use in the
   family practitioner's office as well as in the emergency wards of
   large urban hospitals) are also available.  One of the major concerns
   has been the delivery of cost-effective health care on a global
   basis. At present, participants are initiating the development of
   software and online help files for long term medical care in cases of
   (TBI) traumatic brain injury. These files are particularly oriented
   toward helping survivors of TBI and their families cope with the
   daily need for consultation which might not be available or might
   surpass the economic resources of the family. 
   
   The list should be  of interest to administrators in
   hospitals and universities developers, government officials in the
   sciences and social services, students in medical faculties and
   software and hardware suppliers to government, hospital centres and

   related issues: Usenet censorship (e.g. alt.sex.*), monitoring of the

   Internet access, the responsibilities involved in participating in the
   Usenet/Internet culture, and the newly propsed "Clipper" chip.

   of those six issues, or anything related, your views are more than

   the Geodesic Dome! He invented other means of housing people cheaply, 
   efficiently, comfortably, and basically anywhere in the world! (yes, even 
   on the oceans!) So if you're interested in discussing Bucky, learning more

   source mailing lists in a single forum for quick and compact
   delivery.
   
   As they are received by the Editor-at-large, articles which would
   classify as information will be posted to this list. Headers will
   be stripped and (as much as is possible) articles will be edited to
   remove personal references. This will be done in order to preserve

   request of an original author will this guideline be relaxed. An
   Author may request their name to remain on articles by sending mail
   to the Editor-at-large. All articles posted to GBL-NEWS will have a
   Reply-To: header tag which will point to their list of origin. If
   you are unable to post a reply to the origin list, you will have to
   contact that list's moderator and request that special action be
   taken.
   
   Subscriptions will only be activated by the Editor-at-large.  This is
   designed to shelter the list from unwanted "bashers" who might be
   able to use the list contents to blackmail or coerce members.  By
   default, all subscriptions will have the CONCEAL=TRUE attribute set.

   Apollo Domain DN3500 workstations run by a completely student staff.
   This cluster is not the most stable one in the world but mail here
   generally is.  (Note: I said GENERALLY.) From time to time this
   cluster might disappear off of the net and your submission might not
   make it through.  But these occurrences should be even less frequent
   now with the addition of another network gateway.  So if your
   submission to the list bounces, try again later and the list should be
   back up.
    
   From time to time there will be informational postings from Pete or
   other developers about their products related to the GS/DSP, these
   messages will be archived and if you want send a message to the list
   coordinator and he will forward to you the requested file.
    
   There will be a listing of the available files.  Two files which might be
   of interest include the GS/DSP Preliminary Press Info that was posted to
   comp.sys.apple2, this one and a long question and answer post by Pete
   Snowberg about the DSP board.

   tools used in teaching history to graduate and undergraduate
   students.  As described below, UIC is establishing an electronic
   archive easily accessible to historians.  Syllabi, reading lists, and
   examinations would all be valuable additions to the archive.
   Discussion of cities throughout human history, and in all geographic
   areas is welcome.

   article reviews, announcements, teaching materials, and descriptions
   of tools, techniques, and computer software and hardware -- will be

   on port 70. Connect via a gopher client and then go into the HPV
   directory. (Currently the 8th menu item.)  If you can't see this item

  Description:
   Mailing list for reporting bugs/problems with the Andrew distribution.  
   (See Info-Andrew entry for more detailed description on what "Andrew" is). 
   Official responses to queries and bug reports will be posted to this 
   mailing list.  Topics include: problems discovered in building the distribution;
   problems discovered in running parts of the distribution; and
   questions about difficulties encountered (even if you're not sure
   they're bugs).
   
   When sending a message to this list, you should feel free to include any 
   multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.), that might help to clarify 
   a bug report.  Such images will automatically be stripped out and replaced 
   by "A picture appeared here" before being redistributed to the plain-text 
   recipients.
   
   The list will be moderated, so that all bugs can be tracked and referenced 
   with patch files.   Posts will go out to the subscribers 
   about once a week, summarizing those reports which have been fixed and 
   those still being looked into.
   
   NOTE: All subscription requests will also be added to the Info-Andrew distribution 
   list unless specifically requested not to.

INFO-ANDREW@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

  Owner: Adam Stoller <ghoti+@ANDREW.CMU.EDU>
  Description:
   An informal mailing list intended for general discussion by recipients of 
   the Andrew distribution (and implementors of Andrew).  Andrew, a joint 
   project of Carnegie Mellon University and IBM, is a prototype computing 
   environment for academic and research use under the UNIX operating system. 
   
   There are four main parts to Andrew: the Andrew File System (AFS), a
   large-scale distributed central file system; the Andrew Toolkit (ATK), a
   toolkit for building complex graphical user interface programs in a
   window-manager independent way (currently runs on X11 and the old Andrew
   window manager); the Andrew Message System (AMS), a multi-media mail and
   bulletin board system compatible with non-multi-media systems; and the
   Andrew application programs, a suite of programs that use the ATK to
   provide various useful features. 
   
   Topics can include (but are not limited to): hints about using/building Andrew;
   discussions about desired features, changes, etc.; comments about the
   Andrew distribution (e.g., "it stinks", "it's great"); questions about
   the availability/existence of other parts of Andrew.
   
   The mailing list is available in both Andrew multi-media format (if you 
   have the AMS up and running) and plain-text format.  By default you will be
   sent plain-text versions of the posts, but you can request a change in 
   which version you receive by sending mail to the subscription address.  When 
   sending a message to this list, you should feel free to include any 
   multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.) which might help to express 
   you question, comment, etc.  Such images will automatically be stripped out
   and replaced by "A picture appeared here" before being redistributed to the
   plain-text recipients.
   
   NOTE: All subscription requests will also be added to the
   Info-Andrew-Bugs distribution list unless specifically requested not to.

  Description:
   Digest to provide a speculative forum for analyzing current and likely 
   events in technology as they will affect our near future in computing and 
   related areas.  In broad terms, topics of interest include developments in 
   both computing research and industry which are likely to affect our 
   decision making, particularly decisions we are probably grappling with 
   right this minute.  Technologies can change so rapidly that simply 
   forecasting for needs within any organization one or two years in advance 
   can be extremely difficult, frequently we are forced to provide foundations
   that effectively lock us into a technology for longer periods of time. It 
   is hoped the information this list provides can help both the practitioner 
   and researcher determine where best to expend resources.

   This is a list for users of the Macintosh programming language Prograph.
   Prograph, for those who have not seen it before, is an icon-based
   object-oriented programming language, published by TGS Systems, Halifax,
   Nova Scotia. Prograph includes an application "shell", which makes it
   easy to quickly generate prototypes of your application.  Unlike other
   application generators, such as Serius Developer or AppMaker, Prograph
   is a complete and self-contained programming language, with full access
   to the Mac Toolbox (including System 7 calls).  The versatile
   Interpreter lets you quickly test and debug your code, actually allowing
   you to add new code while your application is running!  Once you have
   your application debugged, the Compiler lets you turn it into a
   standalone, double-clickable Mac application, which you are free to
   distribute as you see fit (no licensing fees are required). 
   
   This list does not have an automated subscription process, so no special
   syntax is required.  Just say you want to subscribe.

   the philosophy of graphic representation (what theories are there of
   graphic representations, and how does a graphic "represent" segments
   of the world);  how can we use graphics in education;  to what extent
   does "graphicacy" matter in today's world;  what is the relationship
   between academic or scientific graphics, and graphics in the popular
   media;  can we or should we accrue rules for "good" graphics;  are
   there graphic variables or elements that are basic to all graphics,
   and can these be used in animation?

   philosophical perspectives, to name a few.  There is also considerable
   interest among participants, in the social realities that lie behind

  Description:
   The Interpersonal Computing and Technology List (IPCT-L) was created
   by the Center for Teaching and Technology (CTT) at the Academic
   Computer Center, Georgetown University.  A special effort will be
   made to promote an international forum for pedagogical issues
   important to higher education involving teaching with technology, and
   especially with connectivity and networking.
    
   This is a forum for the discussion of computing and other
   technology that can be used to promote learning.  Topics for
   discussion may involve teaching and training;  collaboration;
   partnerships among learners, faculty or teachers, and other
   interested persons in the educational community;  and research that
   reflect these interests.  The decade of the 1980s was characterized
   by the personal computer, and development of individual productivity.
   The focus of the IPCT-L, as we move toward the 21st century,
   is that interpersonal computing and technology will tie persons
   together throughout the world -- to share ideas and solve problems.
    
   Besides creating a forum for the topics of interest noted above,
   another interest of the CTT is to publish a scholarly, refereed
   international journal.  To that end, the IPCT-L will develop a
   subscription list and act as a resource to develop the community
   necessary to review articles and recommend editorial policies as
   these publishing goals move forward.

  Description:
   The Learning List was founded on Friday, 13 November 1992, as an
   electronic forum for discussing child-centered learning. It is
   intended to provide a meeting place in cyberspace in which to
   advance our understanding of the processes of learning, and to
   share personal experiences and practical suggestions to help in the
   great adventure we share with our children.
   
   The philosophy behind the list is that humans as a species have an innate ability to
   learn, and that current methods of "teaching", "education" and
   "schooling" serve primarily to thwart or diminish that ability. The
   list members  seek to learn how to best reaffirm and enhance that ability 
   and, above all else, in our children.
   
   List members find inspiration in the writings of such people as John Holt, and
   in the ongoing dialogue in such periodicals as Growing Without
   Schooling.

   The primary purpose of the LOGIC-L list is to provide a forum for the

   information pertaining to the teaching and study of elementary
   logic. For the purposes of this list, 'elementary logic' means the

   with special emphasis upon the apparatus of first-order predicate
   calculus.

   though this is not to be regarded as exclusive of discussions of a
   theoretical character.
   
   Topics covered on this list include: developing trends in the
   teaching of logic; comparison of the levels at which elementary logic
   is taught symbolic logic, metatheory, etc.); new developments in the
   teaching of elementary logic (e.g., modallogic, relevance logic,
   speech act theory, etc.); issues in the philosophy of logic,
   epistemology, cognitive science,linguistics, computer science,
   psychology etc. as they bear upon the teaching of logic; logic
   software available as teaching and learning aids; consideration of
   new (and old) textbooks and their merits; successful (and
   unsuccessful) practices in the teaching of logic (e.g., the use of
   puzzles, humor, paradoxes,), differing testing methods, etc.; the
   relations of logic to ordinary language, and the strengths and
   limitations of formalization; the interrelations between logical and
   rhetorical modes of communication; and the history of the teaching of
   logic, and where it seems to be going as we move into the 21st
   Century. 
   
   The list is unmoderated and open to anyone, from any discipline, with
   a serious academic interest in this area of study.  Questions, shared
   research and insight, relevant conference announcements/calls for
   papers, etc.  are welcome and encouraged.

LYMENET-L@LEHIGH.EDU

  Last Update: 3/10/93
  Description:
   Lyme Disease is now the fastest growing infectious disease in the
   United States.  In 10 short years, this little known bacterial
   infection has claimed half a million victims and the number of new
   patients continues to spiral upward with no relief in sight.  It is
   estimated that in 1991, 100,000 Americans contracted this dangerous
   disease.  If left untreated, LD can cause permanent nerve,
   musculoskeletal and cardiac damage.
   
   Unfortunately, many in the medical and political arenas have not
   given this epidemic much thought.  Self appointed experts in the
   academic community have declared that LD can always be cured with
   short courses of simple antibiotics.  However, as the number of cases
   rise, doctors on the front lines are discovering that LD is more
   serious that previously suspected, requiring longer treatment
   therapies and more complex combinations of medicines.  The battle
   lines have been drawn.
   
   And the battles continue at LD conferences, and in the various State
   legislatures where insurance companies, terrified at the high cost of
   LD, are attempting to short change patients.  Estimates show that the
   average cost of treatment for chronic LD patients ranges from $60,000
   to $100,000 per patient.
   
   This list provides an avenue to keep up with the latest developments,
   including new treatment protocols, research news and political
   events.  LymeNet, in association with the Lyme Disease Network of New
   Jersey, Inc., provides a periodic newsletter with the latest
   information.

   Karl Marx (and Friedrich Engels).   This field encompasses a diversity of differing traditions and 
   figures, from Lenin and Luxemburg to Williams and West; the complete A to Z 
   from Althusser to Zizek, one might say.  
   The list is a forum for open engagement and enquiry with all
   aspects of these Marxist traditions--and we hope that this will be an
   interdisciplinary engagement, bringing together historians, economists,
   sociologists, artists, literary critics, philosophers and so on.

   This list is in some sense a spin-off of the AIList, and as such, a certain
   amount of overlap is expected.  The primary concentration of this list 
   should be NL and KR, that is, natural language (be it understanding, 
   generation, recognition, parsing, semantics, pragmatics, etc.) and how we 
   should represent knowledge (aquisition, access, completeness, etc. are all 
   valid issues).  Topics deemed to be outside the general scope of this list 
   will be forwarded to AIList (or other more appropriate list) or rejected.  
   Readers are warned not to submit any information that is export-controlled 
   or classified.

   This is a mailing list for discussing concepts of computer-generated
   writing especially those related to the theory of the "telical exhaustion
   of the interaction of words."  Telical means, "towards an useful end." 
   The Paramind Brainstorming program, which was created with this theory in
   mind, will be discussed in detail. 
   
   Appropriate topics include: speculating on the theory of "telical
   word-interaction exhaustion."; use of this theory for important
   research; how we can come up with useful and unique statements by
   computer means; examples of uses of the Paramind program, such as merges
   and new word categories.
   
   No long postings from universities, companies or individuals regarding
   AI conferences will be accepted.  To join or be removed from the
   Paramind mailing list, send a message to the subscription address.  This

PEIRCE-L
  Subscription Address: LISTPROC@UNICORN.ACS.TTU.EDU
  Owner: Joseph Ransdell <bnjmr@ttacs.ttu.edu>
  Description:
   This list is open to the discussion of all topics pertaining to the work of the American
   philosopher/logician/scientist Charles Sanders Peirce.
   Since Peirce is especially associated not only with topics in logic
   and the philosophy of science, but also with theory of representation
   and interpretation ("semiotic"), and with the conception of thought
   as essentially communicational and social, the list is highly
   interdisciplinary in membership and discussion content.  But the
   intention is to keep continuing focus on the philosophical basis of
   his thought as well as its special applications, and to encourage
   discussion which is philosophical in content and attitude.  The
   list was begun in August 1993.  The membership of PEIRCE-L, which
   already includes people from some two dozen countries and from a
   remarkable range of disciplines, is not limited to those with academic
   posts or connections, and its members have found no difficulty in
   sustaining discussion at a high level of rigor, a vigorous pace, and
   a geniality of attitude without need for recourse to heavy-handed
   moderation.  There is no standing agenda except the promotion of
   philosophical conversation, and it was founded in the belief that
   a common interest in Peirce's work would turn out to provide an
   unusually good pretext for people getting together on-line to do
   that.
   
   Observers as well as active participants are welcome: this is a
   public forum.  List-based discussion in the liberal arts is in some
   ways more akin to oral than to written discourse, and its rhythms and
   achievements are perhaps best compared with the kind of communication
   that occurs in public squares in those countries which have managed
   to maintain pre-modern traditions of informal public gathering.
   Yet there is a difference, too, in that all discussion is recorded,
   retrievable, and searchable by textstring with Boolean operators, and
   the responses posted in PEIRCE-L are frequently long enough and well-enough developed conceptually to make the advantage of written
   discourse readily apparent, too.  Facilities for a member-donated
   library of pre-prints, work-in-progress, and other secondary materials,
   and of primary material by Peirce himself in digitized form, are in
   preparation.  The list also serves as an information resource for
   professional activities.
   
   This list is sponsored by the Department of Philosophy at Texas Tech
   University, and by The Peirce Telecommunity Project/Electronic Peirce
   Consortium.

POLI-SCI@RUTGERS.EDU
  Subscription Address: POLI-SCI-REQUEST@RUTGERS.EDU
  Owner: JoSH Hall <JoSH@RUTGERS.EDU>
  Description:
   POLI-SCI is a spinoff from the HUMAN-NETS discussion list.  Shortly after 
   the November 1980 election, HUMAN-NETS began to discuss the impact that 
   electronic communications had on the election.  As this discussion 
   continued, it lost its narrow focus on electronic communications and began 
   to consider the election in general, how elections are won and lost, and 
   the nature of the electoral college.  The growth of these discussions, and 
   their spawning of related discussions, indicated that a separate discussion
   list was merited and POLI-SCI was installed.  Since then POLI-SCI has begun
   to consider other topics including the history of the Carter and Nixon 
   presidencies, the Iranian hostage crisis, etc. (with a little less dignity,
   the list might be characterized as a permanent distributed political bull 
   session).

POPULATION-BIOLOGY
  Subscription Address: BIOSCI-SERVER@NET.BIO.NET
  Owner: Vincent Bauchau <VINCENT%BUCLLN11.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU>
  Description:
   Population Biology is a synthesis of population ecology and population 
   genetics, pursuing a unified theory to explain the structure, functioning 
   and evolution of populations of living beings.  Such populations are very 
   complex systems, exhibiting a variety of phenomena that we stil do not 
   master.  Just to quote a famous example, multiannual density cycles (e.g. 
   in lemmings) have not received a satisfactory expalnation, despite of 
   decades of debated studies and speculations.  Population Biology is a very 
   active field, encompassing such diverse approaches as tenacious, harsh 
   field work to track long term demographic and genetic fluctuations, or 
   sophisticated conversations with a computer about strange attractors 
   possibly causing chaos in the density fluctuations.
   
   Topics that can be discussed include: ecology, population genetics, 
   systematics, evolution, morphometry, interspecific competition, 
   sociobiology, mathematical modelling, population regulation, pest control, 
   speciation, chromosomal evolution, social behaviour, statistical 
   methodology in population study, population management of endangered 
   species, applications of molecular biology techniques, etc., and, last but 
   not least, your own topic.  There is no restriction on the species: 
   viruses, protokaryotes, plants, animals (including man), mythic or extinct 
   species, computer-simulated species. Technical problems, book reviews, 
   meeting annoucements and so on are also welcome. This list is gatewayed 
   to the newsgroup bionet.population-bio.

  Description:
   Q-Method is an unmoderated list for the discussion of all aspects of
   Q methodology as innovated and developed by the late William
   Stephenson (1902-1989).  Q methodology is a broad approach to the
   study of subjectivity, and includes issues of theory,
   conceptualization, measurement, and analysis.  Topics for discussion
   may therefore range from the Q-sort technique to Q factor analysis to
   broader concerns about the nature of subjectivity.  Q methodology has
   been applied in psychology, communication, political science,
   advertising, education, law, health and medicine, and many others
   fields.  Discussion may therefore be expected to be diverse with
   respect to illustration while unified with respect to methodological
   principles.  (Q-Method began March 1, 1992 and succeeds QTemp@KentVM,
   which was established as a temporary list on January 14, 1991.)
   
   Archives of Q-Method back issues (including those previously stored

     1. Quality Systems: quality control; quality assurance; statistical
        process control; employee involvement; JIT; & others.
     2. Quality Standards: ISO 9000 (European & International); Baldrige
        (USA); Deming (Japanese); and JIS (Japanese).
     3. Case Studies and Research Papers
   
   In order to prevent "rapid-fire" random e-mail transmissions, all
   messages are relayed to the QUALITY editor for a once or twice
   weekly batch mail release in digest form. In addition, each
   subscriber may disable the automatic QUALITY e-mail transmission
   to their site and download logfiles of each month's e-mail
   traffic.
   
   Datafiles are available for downloading. The objective is to
   develop a clearinghouse of information on TQM.  To receive the
   current listing of files, send the following to the

   The technical purpose of Religion-all is to provide a means of
   distributing information of mutual interest to religion-related lists on
   Mailbase without necessitating the need for "cross-posting."  Religion-all
   does, however, have a wider purpose.  It is not intended as a discussion
   list, all messages sent to the list are forwarded to the moderators rather
   than immediately to the groups concerned, but as a centre of information
   relating to job vacancies, conferences, and general database for religious
   studies in the UK.  Therefore we welcome subscriptions from UK members who
   are not members of the above groups.  Subscribers from other nationalities
   are, of course, also welcome to Religion-all.
   The list is moderated with all messages archived.  An index of messages 
   and files associated with religion-all may be obtained by sending the 
   following command to the subscription address: "INDEX RELIGION-ALL".  
   Subscribers may expect less than one message per day.

  Description:
   SF-LOVERS has discussed many topics, all of them related in some way
   to the theme of science fiction or fantasy.  The topics have ranged very
   widely from rewritten stories, SF and fantasy books, SF movies, and SF
   conventions to reviews of books, movies and television shows.  The range of
   topics is quite wide and anyone is welcome to submit material on these or
   other topics of interest in this general area.
   
   The digest has a very large number of readers, and trivial messages
   are strongly discouraged due to the heavy load SF-LOVERS puts on the hosts
   CPU and disk space.  Messages to SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS.EDU are batched and
   broadcast periodically.
   
   The SF-LOVERS archives are available via anonymous FTP on
   ELBERETH.RUTGERS.EDU in /pub/sfl.  Each volume is contained in its
   own file, with the contents ordered chronologically.  The first
   archive includes a number of messages from the early days before
   digests and there is much of "historical" interest.  Also in the
   archives are some files that may be of interest including episode
   guides for popular television shows.  Some shows covered include: A
   Blakes 7, Doctor Who, Galactica, Galactica 80, Lost In Space, Max
   Headroom, new Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, Prisoner, Quantam Leap,
   Red Dwarf, Star Trek (animated), Star Trek (TNG), and Star Trek. Some

  Description:
   SHABBATSHALOM is a mailing list to distribute the Aish Ha'Torah
   Shabbat Shalom Fax on the internet via e-mail.
   The Aish HaTorah Shabbat Shalom Fax goes out each week by fax to over
   3,000 Jews worldwide.  It is geared to Jews from little or no
   background who want a Jewish connection, a spiritual connection.  The
   purpose is to inform, educate and perhaps to entertain a bit.
   
   The format: Question and Answers about holidays, Jewish practises,
   philosopy and life;  Torah Portion overview for the week;  A Dvar
   Torah, a short word of Torah suitable to share with friends at a
   Shabbat meal, which points out a seeming contradiction or problem in
   the text and presents a solution which teaches us a lesson about life
   (usually drawn from the magnificent works of Rabbi Zelig Pliskin).
   Aish News -- what's happening with Aish HaTorah internationally --
   seminars, publications, new Torah tapes.  Candle lighting times for
   various locals.  And finally, a quote of the week.  Periodically,
   there are Freebies -- offers of free items, catalogs, or other
   opportunities that someone would want.
   
   Written by Rabbi Kalman Packouz, executive director of Aish HaTorah
   Jerusalem's office in Miami Beach, Florida.  Rabbi Packouz is one of
   the first five students at Aish HaTorah, the founder of the first
   Aish HaTorah branch in St.  Louis, Missouri, one of the pioneers in
   the field of Jewish Computer Dating, and an expert in the field of
   preventing intermarriage having written a book on the topic.  He is
   also the father of eight children -- three girls, five boys.

  Subscription Address: LISTSERV@TECHNION.TECHNION.AC.IL
  Owner: Chris Sterritt <chris@adms-rad.unisys.com>, Pieter Stouten <stouten@embl.bitnet>
  Description:
   SHOGI-L, the Shogi Discussion List, is a mailing list started on
   May 6, 1990 about the strategic board game of Shogi. The list 
   serves as a discussion point for Shogi-related topics and as a source of
   information about Shogi tactics and Shogi events. It also offers to Shogi
   players the possibility to engage in e-mail games in a friendly ladder
   competition.
   
   Shogi is much like 'western' chess, but has some very interesting
   differences.  One is that almost all pieces can promote to stronger
   pieces once they reach the opposite side of the board. The second very
   important difference is that when a piece is captured, it becomes a
   piece for the capturing side, and can be dropped back onto the board!
   This makes for a very exciting game, with an extremely low percentage
   of draws. Many strong Chess players, such as International Master
   Larry Kaufman in the US (who is the strongest non-Japanese player
   outside Japan), have found Shogi to be a great game to play.
   
   Although played by millions in Japan, so far it isn't well known outside
   Japan. But surely, there are some net-people out there who would
   like to play or get to know more about it. For Apple Macintosh owners
   we also have a Hypercard Shogi Stack available, which contains
   valuable information for every Shogi novice.

   status of the social sciences, postmodern theory and the social
   sciences, social constructionism, discourse theory, and so on. 
   
   3. Thematically based discussions, eg the interdisciplinary analysis of
   mental illness, deviance, etc.

   should be primarily based around psychology and sociology although other
   disciplines are not excluded).

   Deindividuation; Narrative; Agency and narrative; Methodological

TECHSPIRIT-L
  Subscription Address: LISTSERVER@WILLIAMS.EDU
  Owner: Mark Taylor <mtaylor@williams.edu>, Michael Brown <mbrown@williams.edu>
  Description:
   As the electronic communication revolution gathers momentum, it is
   becoming clear that we are in the midst of a global transformation
   that will change human thought and experience at an unprecedented
   rate.  One of the least expected but most important areas of culture
   to be affected by the electronic revolution is religious and spiritual
   life.  From traditional forms of western and eastern religion to
   recent experimental groups and sects, individuals on a spiritual path
   are searching for new methods of communication, including the Internet
   and related techologies.
   
   This list is for the exploration of the implications of
   technospirituality.  Key questions include, but are by no means
   limited to, the following: What new spiritual possibilities does
   cybertechnology create?  How how are individuals and groups using
   computers and the media to deliver their spiritual message, whatever
   it might be?  How does the technology affect their message?  What
   kinds of spiritual experiments are taking place on the Net right now,
   and where will they lead? 
   
   Within this broad framework, no subject is out of bounds.  We want to
   know what is already going on, what you think should be going on, and
   what you fear might be going on.

   without either confusing readers, ignoring rules of English use, or
   both.  Help!"; "What is vendor-ware?"; "I cannot seem to convince my
   students of the importance of audience analysis when writing
   proposals. Does anyone have exercises or real-life examples which
   might help?".
   
   Other questions explored by this group include:"I am a new technical
   writer at a company manufacturing heavy equipment. My employer
   insists on using terminology which is not consistent with industry
   standards. Users have said is confusing. How might I persuade this
   company to change the policy?";"I just spent three months working on

   reference, or to adapt with attribution, please contact me at

   new tech writing textbook by anonymous? I couldn't find a review in
   Tech Comm.";"I am trying to decide if my company should use

TRDEV-L@PSUVM.PSU.EDU

  Owner: David L. Passmore <DLP@psuvm.psu.edu>
  Description:
   TRDEV-L provides a forum for the exchange of information on the
   training and the development of human resources.  Training is
   designed to improved human work performance on the job, and
   development prepares employees to adjust and grow with the
   organization.  Training and development plays a strategic role in
   organization performance, and human resource professionals have a
   responsibility to explore their field and to expand their knowledge
   base.  Participation in activities such as TRDEV-L assist in
   accomplishing this task.
    
   The primary focus of this list is to stimulate research collaboration
   and assistance in training and development for the academic and
   professional communities.  We invite the discussion of policy and
   practice issues, the posting of position announcements,
   pre-publication drafts of manuscripts, and news and reports of
   conferences.
    
   Because of rapid changes in technology, traditional sources of this
   type of information are no longer adequate.  With this in mind, the
   Institute for Research in Training and Development at Penn State
   University in cooperation with The University Research Council in
   Human Resource Development initiated this network for the ongoing and
   timely exchange of information in this field.  This discussion group,
   managed by the Training and Development Society Graduate Student
   Organization at Penn State, was developed and field-tested through a
   grant from the Technical Foundation of America.
    
   Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived.  You can
   obtain a list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX
   TRDEV-L" command to the subscription address.  These files can then be
   retrieved by means of a "GET TRDEV-L filetype" command.

TREK-REVIEW-L@CORNELL.EDU
  Subscription Address: LISTSERV@CORNELL.EDU
  Owner: Uncle Mikey <mss1@cornell.edu>
  Last Update: 3/12/93
  Description:
   TREK-REVIEW-L exists as a noise-free forum for reviews of Star Trek
   material. This category includes but is not limited to television
   programs, feature films, novels and novelizations, comic books, games
   and parodies of Star Trek.
   The list is not rooted in any specific generation of Trek.  Original
   Series, Animated Series, Movie Era, Next Generation and Deep Space
   Nine materials are all valid.
   
   One way to perceive this list is as a kind of edited electronic
   fanzine.  Where 'rec.arts.startrek.info' is a kind of Trek newspaper,
   containing only hard news and plot summaries, this mailing list exists
   for critical opinion features written by and for the electronic mail
   audience.
   
   There are three categories of acceptable submission: review, rating,
   and comment.
   
   'REVIEW' is defined as a CRITICAL essay about either a specific work
   or Star Trek in general.  Posts of the form, 'I thought that TNG's
   latest episode, "Foo on Picard" was the awesomest episode ever' or,
   similarly, 'I thought that DSN's latest episode, "O'Brien Gets Drunk"
   sucked backwards' are not acceptable.
   
   'RATING' is defined as a graded or numeric rating. If you wish to
   merely register your opinion without critical comment, then you may
   send such a rating to the list address. Ratings collected in this
   manner, as well as copied from reviews, will be posted periodically on
   a per-episode basis.
   
   'COMMENT' is defined as a CRITICAL response to a review. This is not a
   discussion list; however, CRITICAL responses to reviews sent to the
   list address which the moderator believes to be of general interest
   will be bundled together and published in digest format as a 'letter
   column'.
   
   Submissions should be sent to 'TREK-REVIEW-L@cornell.edu'.  Accepted
   submissions are acknowledged by publication. Rejected submissions will
   be acknowledged by a return letter, explaining why the submission was
   rejected.
   
   What the list isn't for:
   
   The list is not a discussion list. Neither, however, is it intended to
   displace 'rec.arts.startrek.current' as another home for reviews.
   Rather, it is intended as an alternative access point to critical
   opinion about Star Trek for people who find
   'rec.arts.startrek.current' overwhelming or cannot access it for some
   reason. It is expected that many of the reviews posted to the list
   will also find their way (assumedly at their author's hands) onto
   'r.a.s.current'. That, therefore, is where discussion should take place.
   
   The list is not for press releases or plot summaries without
   commentary. That's why we have 'rec.arts.startrek.info' (thank you,
   Jim!)
   
   The list is not for the redistribution of commercially published
   reviews, with or without permission. It is for the posting of comments
   for and by members of the various electronic networks that make up or
   exchange mail with The Internet.
   
   The list is not intended as a replacement for proposals to create a
   'rec.arts.startrek.reviews' newsgroup. Rather, it exists to fill the gap
   some feel such a group would also fill until efforts to create such a
   newsgroup are successful. Neither, however, will that newsgroup
   necessarily mean the end of this list.

  Description:
   TRNSPLNT is a discussion list for organ transplant recipients and
   anyone else intested in the issues, experiences and realities of
   living with an organ trasplant.  Over the last 30 years, the number
   of transplants performed each year has grown steadily in both
   absolute numbers and type of organs transplanted.
   
   Though there are hospital, clinical and pharmaceutical
   industry-sponsored newsletters, there are few, if any, completely
   independent discussion forums for those who have experienced this
   oftentimes dramaticaly effective therapy.
   
   There are many life issues for the transplant patient that are simply
   not covered in medical literature or by medical personnel.  TRNSPLNT
   will provide a way for members to share information on such things as
   as travel, both domestic and abroad, how to deal with a compromised
   immune system, stories about transplant experiences, and anything
   that the members feel is worth discussing.
   
   Archives of TRNSPLNT postings can be listed by sending an "INDEX
   TRNSPLNT" command to LISTSERV@WUVMD.WUSTL.EDU.
   
   NOTE: This is NOT a medical forum!  Though advice may be offered, you
   should, as with any medical issue, check with your physician before
   you accept anything said in this forum as a basis for doing anything
   that might affect your physical condition!

   who just like the idea of having their evening's entertainment choices
   pop up on their computer screen every day when they log in. 
   
   Every morning, you'll get a new e-mail which summarizes the evening's
   best viewing, followed by a complete programming guide for all major
   broadcast and cable networks.  This will include cable stations that
   many major newspapers don't have the space to list, such as Comedy
   Central, the Science Fiction channel, MTV, etc.  It will also let you
   know who's scheduled to appear on the evening's late night talk shows. 
   
   Of course, even those of us blessed with 70 channels sometimes
   experience an evening where there isn't a thing on the tube we have any
   desire to see.  So the list editors will also let you know when new
   videos are released, on the day they're due to hit the stores.  
   
   One cautionary note: listings are not provided for local stations so you
   won't see listings for syndicated shows like the "Star Trek" series, or
   for your local PBS station.

  Subscription Address: URBANITES-REQUEST@PSYCHE.MIT.EDU
  Owner: Stephen G. Wadlow <sgw@silver.lcs.mit.edu>
  Description:
   The purpose of this mailing list is to discuss and promote self-sufficiency
   in everyday life in many forms.  This includes but is not limited to basic 
   needs such as food, shelter, health, and safety.  A unique aspect of this 
   list, however, unlike many others, is that we will concentrate on the city 
   and urban/semi-urbs applications of traditional self-sufficiency 
   technology.  Thus, discussions on raising fish in a small backyard pool or 
   in a large aquarium instead of in cage-culture rafts on a farm pond; 
   raising veggies and some small-tree fruits in containers on the patio or 
   under grow-lights at work (a ready source of fluorescent fixtures for most 
   of us!) instead of in a 20 x 40 garden plot "out back".
   
   Certainly folks in a more suburban setting (lucky them!) will find much of 
   the "urbanites" content useful, but the list is here first and foremost for
   those of us out here in the Concrete Jungle, for whatever reason.  Some of 
   us, like myself, are here using the city's resources to learn before 
   setting off for the country or the 'burbs, some are stuck in pay-our-debts 
   jobs here, and some just like the active city environment of places like 
   Harvard Square or Pike's Place.  But even though we rent our dwellings and 
   have a postage-stamp size yard, or none at all, we can still get into doing
   for ourselves in some of the ways our bucolic buddies do.
   
   Send requests to be added directly to the subscription address
   and include  "urbanites-request" in your subject line.

VIRUS-L%TRITU.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
  Subscription Address: LISTSERV@CC.ITU.EDU.TR
  Owner: Kenneth R. van Wyk <LUKEN@VAX1.CC.LEHIGH.EDU>
  Description:
   Virus-L is a forum specifically for the discussion of computer virus 
   experiences, protection software, and other virus related topics.  The list
   is currently open to the public and is a non-digest format list.  Readers 
   who prefer digest format lists should periodically read the public back 
   logs of submissions, available from the submission address.
   
   Archives are available, as is a file called DIRTY DOZEN which lists a 
   number of viruses, trojan horses, and pirated programs for the IBM PC.  All
   submissions to VIRUS-L are stored in weekly log files which can be 
   downloaded by any user on (or off) the mailing list.  There is also a small
   archive of some of the public anti-virus programs which are currently 
   available.  This archive, too, can be accessed by any user.  All of this is
   handled automatically by the LISTSERV.
   
   To find out what files are available on the LISTSERV, send mail to 
   the subscription address saying "INDEX VIRUS-L".
   Note that filenames/extensions are separated by a space, and not by a 
   period.  Once you've decided which file(s) you want, send mail to LISTSERV 
   saying "GET filename filetype".
   For example, GET VIRUS-L LOG8804 would get the file called VIRUS-L LOG8804 
   (which happens to be the monthly log of all messages sent to VIRUS-L during
   April, 1988).  Note that, starting June 6, 1988, the logs are weekly.  The 
   new file format is VIRUS-L LOGyymmx where yy is the year (88, 89, etc.), mm
   is the month, and x is the week (A, B, etc.).  Readers who prefer digest 
   format lists should read the weekly logs and sign off of the list itself.

   using  MACRO-32,  the  VAX  assembly  language.   This  list  is  currently
   unmoderated.   All  topics relating to VMS systems programming are welcome,

VMVIRUS%PCCVM.BITNET@CMSA.BERKELEY.EDU
  Subscription Address: LISTSERV%PCCVM.BITNET@CMSA.BERKELEY.EDU
  Owner: R N Hathhorn <SYSMAINT@PCCVM>
  Description:
   This list has been established to act as a clearing house / archival
   location for comments and information concerning VM viruses and
   worms.  The logs are public and members' comments well be freely
   available to the network community.  The list owner also stores samples
   of source, object, and executable code for examination by selected
   persons.  Commonly these files will only be available to NADs and
   other selected interested parties.  Application may be made for code
   samples.  Userid authenticity will be verified prior to dispersal of
   infectious programs. Be aware that a posting to this list
   will automatically be forwarded to VIRUS-L.
   
   So far the VM community has been spared many of the problems that
   currently plague the PC, MAC and Unix worlds.  Let us hope that it
   remains that way.  This archive is intended as a step in the
   direction to halt the spread of such malicious programming.
   
   While the name VMVIRUS implies a limitation to the VM environment,
   this list is open to comments by MVS and VSE users also.  The list owner
   urges VM, MVS, and VSE sites to send samples of infectious code for
   storage.  The following rules MUST be adhered to in the transmission
   of potentially harmful programs.
   
   1) Send notification to the list owner prior to transmission.
   
   2) De-activate the code if possible
   
   3) Transmit the code to SECURE@PCCVM
   
   4) Do not include code in a 'mail-gram'
   
   This site maintains a 'filter' for known infectious materials, hence
   the required pre-transmission notification.  Let all work together to
   restore the 'clean' computing environment that we used to have and to
   assist in the eradication / prosecution of offenders.

  Last Update: 8/16/94
  Description:
   The purpose of the mailing list is to discuss topics related to to the
   use of WWW for purchased information.  Potential information providers
   would willingly make a vast array of information available on the
   World-Wide Web (WWW) if they knew they could get paid for it.  The
   system should work like this: using your favorite WWW client program,
   when you select a hypertext link ("buyinfo link") that reaches a server
   that charges money for the information, the server informs the client
   program (via HTTP) that there is an associated charge and lists the
   available payment options.  The client can give up, either because it
   has no payment capability or because the user chooses not to buy the
   information.  Otherwise the client passes the server some information
   (via HTTP) that will enable the server to be reimbursed for the
   information.  The server then returns that purchased information.  If
   the client is designed in a way that the user can make money available
   beforehand (and with a suitable user-protection interface), a user could
   traverse buyinfo links effortlessly, and the financial details would
   occur invisibly. 
   
   These components are required to implement the vision: http: to allow
   the exchange of cost and payment information; client/server application
   programmer interfaces (APIs) that make it easy to add different kinds of
   payment schemes; clients that provide an attractive, convenient, safe
   interface to support payment; ways to support transactions in multiple
   currencies.  Other relevant topics for this mailing list: the privacy of
   financial transactions; authentication of payers; the efficiency of
   payment schemes. 
   
   This mailing list is NOT for discussion about: whether charging for
   information is a good idea or how to exchange orders electronically.

WWWORDER@EINET.NET
  Subscription Address: LISTPROC@EINET.NET
  Owner: Glenn Fleishman
  Description:
   World-Wide Web Order Forms mailing list.  This list was started to
   discuss the issue of creating catalogs in World-Wide Web format from
   which orders may be placed. Someone browsing a WWW database of items
   should be able to tag those items on the pages on which they see them
   and a create a running list. Since WWW is modeless, and there's no
   particular concept of a session, some imposed method of tagging that
   user and their entries must be used to identify an individual and a
   session. 
   
   The user selects items to purchase or otherwise group from various HTML
   pages. At any time, they can leap to an order form or summary document that
   shows everything that they have chosen so far. When their selections are
   complete--they must choose some arbitrary stopping point, much like filling
   in a paper order form in a catalog--they submit this form.
   
   The HTTP server should be able to compile all the tagged items into an
   order form and send it back in HTML form to the user. Further, some lookup
   through an external database--possibly SQL based--should return values for
   each item if at all possible. In the case of a catalog with orderable
   items, the server should receive the completed form and reply with a filled
   out form showing unit prices, totals, shipping, and other costs. They could
   then confirm the order and the total.
   
   Some of this is currently possible via CGI and Forms, but it's not
   necessarily implemented anywhere. Because WWW is inherently non-interactive
   as well as modeless, it's not easy to prompt for information that's
   required without a lot of back and forth.
   
   Possibly the answer is customized HTML browsers that can support order
   forms inherently and have true interactivity (but not modes). Possibly,
   it's all feasible using the existing and burgeoning technology.
   Also of interest to the subscribers of this list is the related
   subject of how an order can be processed, including authentification of
   users and credit card information.

Y-RIGHTS@SJUVM.STJOHNS.EDU
  Subscription Address: LISTSERV@SJUVM.STJOHNS.EDU
  Owner: Kenneth Udut <KUDUT@RITZ.MORDOR.COM>
  Last Update: 1/28/92
  Description:
   As the title suggests, this list is on the discussion of the rights
   of kids and teenagers (called Y-Rights for "Youth Rights", or
   "Youngster's Rights" or "Why Rights?" -- whichever strikes your
   fancy).  It's a very open list, and everyone is welcome to participate
   on it, whether you are a teacher, a professional, a student, or a kid
   or teenager yourself.
   
   What do I mean when I say "Children's Rights"?  Well, I don't
   necessarily mean the rights for adults to "protect" children, because
   that "right" seems to be misused and misguided to ends that are,
   oftentimes, tragic, even with the 'best' intentions.  That, of
   course, is open for discussion on this list, and I'm certain that it
   will come up at some point.
   
   In my ever changing view of rights for those under the `age of
   majority' (which is 18 or 21 in the United States, depending on how
   you view it, and different in other countries), I am looking more for
   changes in our judicial system, educational system, and our society,
   as a whole, to view youth as Human Beings first and foremost, before
   concerning themselves with the `correct manners to treat, mold and
   shape a child', as if s/he is just a ball of clay, and not a human
   being.
