Andre - Here is a 144kb listing of all the interest groups.  Your
guess about isib and b.isi is correct.  The new domain naming convention
is the b.isi.  The difference between info-ibmpc and info-ibmpc-request
is that request is the address used to get on the list.  Your return
address of UZ32112%BLIULG12.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU is correct.
All I can suggest is that you can try sending a request to the request
address and ask for confirmation of your request to be added to the
list.

I'll send the two most recent info-ibmpc digests as separate notes.

EVOLUTION@KESTREL

   This direct-distribution mailing list is organized to discuss
consequences 
   of the theory of evolution, with emphasis on mathematics, on computer
   simulations, and on literature.  While creationists in this group are
   expected to be few in number, and while they may not reasonably
expect to be
   taken seriously unless they can introduce radically better evidence
than 
   creationists have in the past, we have no agreement to limit
discussion of 
   contraversal topics.  The coordinator assumes no responsibility for
opinions
   expressed in the group or for misuse.

HUMAN-NETS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Mailing list originally consisting of the combined memberships of 
   INFO-PCNET, HOME-SAT, and TELETEXT mailing lists.  Human-Nets has
discussed 
   many topics, all of them related in some way to the theme of a
world-wide 
   computer and telecommunications network usually called WorldNet.  The
topics
   have ranged very widely, from something like tutorials, to state of
the art 
   discussions, to rampant speculation about technology and its impact.
The 
   list is extremely large, making it necessary to batch messages sent
to the 
   list and distributing them once each day during off peak periods to
avoid 
   overloading the system.

   The permanent archives contain all of the material distributed to the
list. 
   Due to size, this archive is broken down into several different
files, 
   stored in reverse temporal order.  The files are currently stored on
ARPANet
   host RU-BLUE in files RHYTHM:<PLEASANT.HUMAN-NETS>HUMNET.* (where "*"
is a

INFO-1100@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU
BUG-1100@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU

   These discussion lists focus on Xerox 1100 workstations (1100, 1108,
1132, 
   1185, 1186) and protocols.  Their purpose is to stimulate
communication and 
   sharing between computer science research groups that are using or
are 
   interested in these machines.

   Info-1100 is the "information channel" where messages such as
announcements 
   of available lispusers packages may be made or for queries such as
"Does 
   anybody know of a PUP file server implementation for the Sinclair
ZX-80?".  
   It is intended to be a low-volume list suitable for the casual
reader.  
   Bug-1100 is the "bug channel" where readers can warn others of
Interlisp-D 
   bugs and/or suggest workarounds or solicit help or discussion; it is 
   expected to have greater volume than Info-1100, being for the
hard-core 
   user.  Since hard-core users read both lists, Bug-1100 is a subset of
   Info-1100 and there is never a need to send to both lists.

   Xerox PARC, SIS, and AIS people are included in the distribution list
to 
   facilitate communication about new developments, bugs, performance
issues, 
   etc..  Additionally, Info-1100 and Bug-1100 are automatically
forwarded to 
   AISupport.pasa@Xerox, where bugs are noted and acted upon if
appropriate. 
   Xerox AIS employees will not respond in Bug-1100 unless the reply is
of 
   general interest or silence would mislead the readership.

   Archives of messages are kept on SUMEX-AIM in files:
      <BBOARD>INFO-1100.TXT      <BBOARD>BUG-1100.TXT
   Some net-contributed lispusers packages, updates, and patches are
kept on 
   SUMEX-AIM in files:
      <LISPUSERS.INTERMEZZO>      <LISPUSERS.KOTO>      etc.

   Requests to be added to or deleted from these lists, problems,
questions, 
   etc. should be sent to Info-1100-Request@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU or

INFO-FUTURES%BU-CS@CSNet-Relay.ARPA
      INFO-FUTURES@BU-CS (CSNET)
      ...harvard!bu-cs!info-futures (UUCP)

   Digest to provide a speculative forum for analyzing current and
likely 
   events in technology as they will affect our near future in computing
and 
   related areas.  In broad terms, topics of interest include
developments in 
   both computing research and industry which are likely to affect our
decision
   making, particularly decisions we are probably grappling with right
this 
   minute.  Technologies can change so rapidly that simply forecasting
for 
   needs within any organization one or two years in advance can be
extremely 
   difficult, frequently we are forced to provide foundations that
effectively 
   lock us into a technology for longer periods of time. It is hoped the
   information this list provides can help both the practitioner and
researcher
   determine where best to expend resources.

INFO-IBMPC@USC-ISIB

   Info-IBMPC is a forum for technical discussion of the IBM Personal
Computer 
   and compatible micro-computers, providing a way for interested
members of 
   the ARPANET community to compare notes, ask questions, and share
insights of
   a technical nature about these machines.  While it is not primarily a
   consumer's guide to the IBM PC, the digest may also be useful for
that 
   purpose.

   Messages are collected, edited into digests and distributed as the
volume of
   mail dictates (generally twice a week).  All messages of a technical
nature 
   about IBM PCs are welcomed; messages about other topics will not be
run.  In
   addition, two topics are taboo and are routinely edited out: (1) self
   promotion of products for sale, and (2) anything about copy
protection.

   Recent digests are archived on USC-ISIB in <INFO-IBMPC>DIGESTS-85.
Older 
   digests are archived by quarter in the following files:

      Q1-DIGESTS-85   ; V4 # 1-40 [too big for mm, use hermes]
      Q4-DIGESTS-84   ; V3 # 91-119

      Q1-DIGESTS-83   ; V2 # 1-19
      Q34-DIGESTS-82  ; V1 # 1-34

      These files can be read by MM, HERMES, and other TOPS20 mail
systems. 
      KWIC-INDEX.TXT contains a key-word-in-context index to digest
articles.  
      TOC.???85 contains a table of contents for the month ???. These
files may
      be FTP'ed to any Arpanet/Milnet host from [USC-ISIB]<INFO-IBMPC>
by 
      logging in within FTP using username ANONYMOUS, password GUEST.
If 
      you're not directly on the Arpanet the files can be mailed to you,
      although there is a limit to the length of a message.

   A library of free software is maintained in [USC-ISIB]<INFO-IBMPC>.
The 
   list of available programs is in <INFO-IBMPC>PROGRAM-LIBRARY.LIST.
Donations
   of source code are eagerly welcomed (even trivial programs). Donated

INFO-KERMIT@CU20B

   Kermit is a file transfer protocol for use primarily between micros
and 
   mainframes over TTY lines, and is implemented on a wide variety of
both. The
   Info-Kermit mailing list is a digest intended for people who maintain
or 
   install Kermit at their sites, or who are (thinking about) working on
a new 
   implementation, or who have bugs and/or fixes to report, or who are 
   interested in discussing the protocol; it is available on Internet,
CSnet, 
   Mailnet, BITnet, Usenet, CCnet, and any other network gatewayed to
the 
   Internet.

   All the Kermit files are on CU20B in the area "KER:" or "K2:".  The
file 
   KER:AAAREAD.ME contains information on what files are in the Kermit 
   distribution area and how to find them.  One file worth checking from
time 
   to time is KER:AAVNEW.HLP, a brief tabular listing of each existing
version 
   of Kermit, showing the version number and date of the latest release
of each
   version.  The file KER:AANETW.HLP lists in detail the procedures for 
   obtaining Kermit files via network.

   Kermit files, including program source and documentation, are
available as 
   follows:

      Internet: anonymous FTP from host CU20B, area KER: or K2:, 24
hours a 
      day, 7 days a week.

      BITnet: from the KERMSRV server at host CUVMA; type SMSG RSCS MSG
CUVMA 
      KERMSRV HELP for further information.

      UUCP: from Oklahoma State University (host okstate) in Stillwater,
OK. 
      Mail to uucp-support%okstate@CSNET-RELAY for further information. 
      Selected sources (usually Unix-related) are posted to net.sources
from 
      time to time.

      CCNET: DECnet NFT from host CU20B.  Anonymous NFT connections are
not 
      permitted from all hosts, so file transfers must be made by system
      managers or programmers who have access to CU20B.

      U.S. Mail: send requests for information to:

         Kermit Distribution
         Columbia University Center for Computing Activities
         612 West 115 Street
         New York, NY  10025

   Info-Kermit mail was direct up until May 23, 1984, when it became a
digest. 
   The pre-digest messages are in KER:MAIL.83A and KER:MAIL.84A.  Volume
1 of 
   the digest is in KER:MAIL.84B.  The current, active digest is in 
   KER:MAIL.TXT.  From time to time, active digests will be retired to
files 
   with names like KER:MAIL.85A, KER:MAIL.85B, and so on.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to INFO-KERMIT-REQUEST@CU20B.  If your host does

GOTO), 
   separate compilation with a module (compilation unit) broken into 
   specification and implementation parts with importing and exporting
of 
   objects, controlled machine level access, and concurrent programming
and 
   coroutines.  Modula-2 has most of the power of Ada but is small
enough that 
   excellent full implementations exist for CP/M 80.

   Mail archives are stored on SIMTEL20 in file:
      <ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>MODULA-2-ARCHIV.TXT
   They are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from SIMTEL20 for those with

INFO-PCNET@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

   INFO-PCNET is a general mailing list to keep interested people
advised of 
   major developments.

   PCNET is a volunteer effort creating a computer network for personal
use. 
   Although meant to be device independent, the current design is
oriented to 
   use through the telephone system, particularly by computers with
automatic 
   dialing and receipt of calls.  PCNET will enable all computer users,
whether
   part of a formal network organization or individual owners of
personal 
   computers, to communicate with each other effectively.  PCNET is
defining 
   communication protocols that assure that transmissions are correct 
   (retransmitting data that is lost or erroneous), and which allow
multiple 
   logical data streams so that several programs can share a single
hardware 
   communication link.  PCNET has defined a worldwide addressing
standard that 
   permits automatic forwarding of messages and files without having to
know 
   the topology of the network.

   PCNET is currently finising software on several machines (8080, 6502,
   PDP-10) using several languages (Assembly language, LISP, C), and
refining 
   the documentation; volunteer communications programmers are needed to
   complete these tasks.

   The PCNET files are on SIMTEL20 in directory PD:<PCNET>.  SIMTEL20
supports 
   ANONYMOUS login within FTP them using any non-null password.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to INFO-PCNET-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

INFO-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.ARPA
BUG-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.ARPA

   The INFO-TMODEM list is a means for the maintainer of the TMODEM
program to 
   send notices to users of TMODEM.  Users of TMODEM send bug reports
and 
   feature requests to BUG-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.

   TMODEM is a new TOPS-20 implementation of the Christensen Protocol,
with all
   the latest features, such as:
      o  wildcard file transfers in the style of MODEM7
         (YMODEM batch is coming)
      o  the YMODEM implementation of the K option with a new algorithm
         to return to K mode after falling back to "normal" mode
      o  extensive built-in HELP for all commands and options.
   TMODEM is an amalgamation of the old TOPS-20 MODEM program,
originally 
   written by Bill Westfield while he was at SRI and now at Stanford,
major 
   pieces of the TOPS-20 TELNET program, currently maintained by Mark
Crispin, 
   and some pieces of code stolen from TTLINK and KERMIT-20 by Frank da
Cruz at
   Columbia University.

   The archives for replaced mailing list INFO-MODEMXX are frozen in 
   <ARCHIVES.MODEMXX> on SIMTEL20.  A new set of archives for
INFO-TMODEM is on
   SIMTEL20 in <ARCHIVES.TMODEM>TMODEM-ARCHIV.TXT.  The source for
TMODEM is in
   TOPS-20:TMODEM.MAC, and must be compiled for each individual TOPS-20
system 
   environment.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

   IRList is open to discussion of any topic related to information
retrieval. 
   Certainly, any material relating to ACM SIGIR is of interest.  The IR
field 
   has close ties to artificial intelligence, database management,
information 
   and library science, linguistics,... A partial list of topics
suitable are:

      Information Management/Processing/Science/Technology
      AI Applications to IR          Indexing

      Conference Announcements     Conference Reports
      Bibliographies               History of IR
      Queries and Requests         Address Changes

   The only real boundaries to the discussion are defined by the topics
of 
   other mailing lists.  Please do not send communications to both this
list 
   and AIList or the Prolog list, except in special cases.

   Please "sign" subscriptions with full name and address so that people
can 
   access you from Internet and/or BITNET (many other networks can be
reached 
   through them and are certainly urged to participate).

   There is no objection to distributing material that is destined for 
   conference proceedings or any other publication.  The Coordinator is 
   involved in SIGIR Forum and, unless submittors request otherwise, may
   include submissions in whole or in part in future paper versions of
the 
   FORUM.  Indeed, this is one form of solicitation for FORUM
contributions!  
   Both IRList and the FORUM are unrefereed, and opinions are always
those of 
   the author and not of any organization unless there are other
indications.  
   Copies of list items should credit the original author, not
necessarily the 
   IRList.

   Archival copies of all digests will be kept; feel free to ask
IRList-Request
   for recent back issues.  Note that FTP is not possible, so all
communication
   must be by EMAIL, phone, or letter.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions,

LIST OF MAILING LISTS

   Mailing-list for "List of lists" update notices.

   There is a master list of ARPANET mailing-lists/digests/discussion
groups 
   (~140 lists/2600+ lines/120,000+ characters) on SRI-NIC in files:
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-1.TXT  (first half of the list)
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-2.TXT  (second half of the list)
      For ARPANET users, SRI-NIC supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS
      login within FTP, with any password.

   To keep people up to date on the large number of such lists, there is
a 
   mailing-list for list-of-lists \update notices/.  Copies of the list
itself 
   are not sent to the world at large, but for those ARPANET users who 
   seriously intend to FTP the updated versions when updated, a brief
notice 
   will be sent when a new version is available.  For those liaisons at 
   internet sites who maintain or redistribute copies for their own
networks 
   (DECNet, Xerox, BitNet, MailNet, etc.) and can't reach the master by
ARPANET
   FTP, the complete new file will be sent if necessary.  File copies
will not 
   normally be sent to individual users, either ARPANET or internet.

   To get on the list (or to submit updates to existing mailing-lists or
add 
   new ones), send requests to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>

Love-Hounds@MIT-Eddie

   This is a mailing list for the discussion of Kate Bush's music (and
any 
   other artistic music or anything else for that matter).

MHS_(X.400)_Implementation%QZCOM@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA
MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@RSCH.WISC.EDU
MHS_implementation@EAN.UBC.CDN

   A QZCOM conference with the name "MHS (X.400) implementation"; the 
   conference will have the name "MHS_(X.400)_implementation" for mail 
   networks, in most cases postfixed  by "%QZCOM@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA".  The
   conference/mailing list is open to anyone who is seriously interested
in  
   implementing the CCITT X.400 (MHS) message handling protocols or
gateways to
   these protocols.  The conference/mailing list can discuss such things
as how
   to understand and interpret the MHS recommendation, how to map
existing mail
   system and mail network features onto the MHS structure etc.

   To minimize international communications costs, separate distribution
lists 
   for CSNET/ARPANET and CDNNET users are being maintained at UWISC and
UBC 
   respectively.  ARPANET and CSNET users should send messages to 
   MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@WISC-RSCH.  CDNNET users should send messages to 
   MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@EAN.UBC.CDN.  Messages sent to one of the lists
will be 
   forwarded to members of the other lists.

   To join the conference:
      QZCOM users:
         Use the "member" command.
      ARPANET/CSNET users:
         Send a message to  MHS_IMPLEMENTATION-REQUEST@RSCH.WISC.EDU
      CDNNET users:
         Send a message to MHS_IMPLEMENTATION-REQUEST@EAN.UBC.CDN
      Users at other sites:
         Send a message to
"Jacob_Palme_QZ%QZCOM.MAILNET@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA",
         do NOT send mail to the conference itself.

   received.

   Archives will be kept on SIMTEL20 in files:
      PS:<MAIL.ARCHIVES>MILSIM.ARCHIV.ymmdd
      PS:<MAIL.ARCHIVES>MILSIM.ARCHIV.TXT

      The characters "ymmdd" in the first filename are actually digests
giving 
      the year, month, and day of the last message in the file.  The
second 
      file contains a growing list of current messages.  SIMTEL20
supports 
      ANONYMOUS FTP (with any non-null password).

music-research%prg.oxford.ac.uk@CS.UCL.AC.UK

   The Music-Research electronic mail redistribution list was
established after
   a suggestion made at a meeting in Oxford in July 1986, to provide an 
   effective and fast means of bringing together musicologists, music
analysts,
   computer scientists, and others working on applications of computers
in 
   music research.  Initially, the list was established for people whose
chief 
   interests concern computers and their applications to

      - music representation systems
      - information retrieval systems for musical scores
      - music printing
      - music analysis
      - musicology and ethnomusicology
      - tertiary music education
      - databases of musical information

   The following areas are not the principal concern of this list,
although 
   overlapping subjects may well be interesting:

      - primary and secondary education
      - sound generation techniques
      - composition

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

NAMEDROPPERS@SRI-NIC.ARPA

   The NAMEDROPPERS mailing list is to be used for discussion of the
concepts, 
   principles, design, and implementation of the domain style names.
The main 
   focus of this group is the review of documents describing domain
style 
   names.  This is a list for participants in a discussion, not
observers.  
   Everyone on the list is expected to contribute from time to time.

   Nearly everyone in NAMEDROPPERS is also on HEADER-PEOPLE and also on 
   MSGGROUP.  There is no need to send a message to both NAMEDROPPERS
and 
   either of these lists (and certianly not both!).

   All of the previous NAMEDROPPERS discussion can be found in SRI-NIC
files
      <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.198X
   where X is the number of the year of the archive you are looking for.
A/O 
   Jan 85, there are archives for 1983, 1984 and 1985.  
   <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.MAIL still contains the most current
NAMEDROPPERS 
   dialog.  These files can be accessed via anonymous FTP; new members
may wish
   to copy and read these archives before joining the discussion.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

NL-KR@ROCHESTER.ARPA

   NL-KR is open to discussion of any topic related to the natural
language 
   (both understanding and generation) and knowledge representation,
both as 
   subfields of AI.  The Moderator's interests are primarily in:

      Knowledge Representation    Natural Language Understanding
      Discourse Understanding     Philosophy of Language
      Plan Recognition            Computational Linguistics

   Contributions are also welcome on topics such as:

      Cognitive Psychology (as related to NL/KR)
      Human Perception (same)
      Linguistics
      Machine Translation
      Computer and Information Science (as may be used to implement
various
      Logic Programming (same)                                   NL
systems)

   Contributions may be anything from tutorials to speculation. In
particular, 
   the following are sought:

      Abstracts                             Reviews
      Lab Descriptions                      Research Overviews
      Work Planned or in Progress           Half-Baked Ideas
      Conference Announcements              Conference Reports
      Bibliographies                        History of NL/KR
      Puzzles and Unsolved Problems         Anecdotes, Jokes, and Poems
      Queries and Requests                  Address Changes (Bindings)

   This list is in some sense a spin-off of the AIList, and as such, a
certain 
   amount of overlap is expected. The primary concentration of this list
should
   be NL and KR, that is, natural language (be it understanding,
generation, 
   recognition, parsing, semantics, pragmatics, etc.) and how we should 
   represent knowledge (aquisition, access, completeness, etc. are all
valid 
   issues).  Topics deemed to be outside the general scope of this list
will be
   forwarded to AIList (or other more appropriate list) or rejected.

   Archival copies of all digests will be kept; feel free to ask
NL-KR-REQUEST 
   for recent back issues.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to NL-KR-REQUEST@ROCHESTER.ARPA.

POLI-SCI@RUTGERS

   POLI-SCI is a spinoff from the HUMAN-NETS discussion list.  Shortly
after 
   the November 1980 election, HUMAN-NETS began to discuss the impact
that 
   electronic communications had on the election.  As this discussion 
   continued, it lost its narrow focus on electronic communications and
began 
   to consider the election in general, how elections are won and lost,
and the
   nature of the electoral college.  The growth of these discussions,
and their
   spawning of related discussions, indicated that a separate discussion
list 
   was merited and POLI-SCI was installed.  Since then POLI-SCI has
begun to 
   consider other topics including the history of the Carter and Nixon 
   presidencies, the Iranian hostage crisis, etc. (with a little less
dignity, 
   the list might be characterized as a permanent distributed political
bull 
   session).

   Archived digest messages are stored on RUTGERS in:
      <poli-sci>mail.txt
      and other files in the <poli-sci> directory

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

PROLOG[-HACKERS]@SU-SCORE

   Prolog and logic programming mailing lists.

   Some of the people answering the initial BBoard message stated that
they 
   would be interested in general Prolog and logic programming
information, but
   not in the nitty-gritty details of Prolog systems and their bugs.
Therefore,
   two mailing lists have been set up, PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS: PROLOG
will 
   provide a digest of articles of general interest; PROLOG-HACKERS will
   provide a direct mailing for the nasty stuff.  Finally,
PROLOG-REQUEST 
   should be used for distribution requests.  In a nutshell:

      Mail to                 for
      -------                 ---

      PROLOG@SCORE            sending articles of general interest 
      PROLOG-HACKERS@SCORE    sending articles of limited interest 
      PROLOG-REQUEST@SCORE    getting in and out of the mailing lists
                               and other bureaucracy

   Please do not send the same message to PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS.
Messages 
   will be moved between lists if appropriate.

   An archive of the USEnet prolog interest group interchange can be
FTP'd from
   host SU-SCORE using standard anonymous login convention.  The
pathname is:

The 
   eventual goal is to devise (and implement) an all-purpose standard
protocol 
   for FTP.

Psychnet <EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU>

   PSYCHNET (tm) is a psychology Newsletter and mailing list, sending
out 
   information, news, and academic papers to those who sign up.  An
initial 
   formal purpose of Psychnet is distribution of academic papers in
advance of 
   the 1986 APA convention; other purposes will develop according to the
needs 
   and interests of the profession and Psychnet users.

   Outside BitNet, Psychnet is a Newsletter and mailing list only.  Once
per 
   week, members receive the latest Psychnet Newsletter and Index of
files 
   available on the server machine.  If a file looks interesting send an
E-mail
   request to EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU and the file will
be sent 
   to you.

   Within BitNet, Psychnet is also a 24-hour server machine which mails
out 
   files to users who first send the PSYCHNET HELP command to userid
UH-INFO at
   node UHUPVM1 (*NOT* to userid EPSYNET).  Persons within BitNet may
also sign
   up for the mailing list and will get the Newsletter and Index along
with 
   other news.  BitNet users, however, should get their files directly
from the
   server machine; an Exec file is available for CMS users and COM files
are 
   available for VAX users within BitNet.

   To have a file or idea distributed to members of the list send it to
the 
   primary list address and it will be sent out, usually with the week's
   Psychnet Newsletter.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from the mailing list, or to
have 
   files distributed should be sent to
EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU.

will be 
   about Scribe features, bugs, enhancements, performance, support, and
other 
   topics of interest to Scribe DBAs.  The list will NOT be moderated,

SECURITY@RUTGERS

   This list is designed to provide a forum for discussion of the field
of 
   security in general, be it electronic, physical, or computer-related.
Since
   the original idea was to name this list LOCKSMITHS, discussions about
   physical security and hardware are welcomed, but to broaden out into 
   computer security and electronic access control and such is also
valid.  In 
   other words, any subject matter relating to the *improvement* and 
   *implementation* of security systems is okay, while how to *defeat*
them is 
   not.  Messages are not digestified, but are filtered to keep things
of 
   questionable legality/ content from escaping out to the network.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to SECURITY-REQUEST@RUTGERS.

SF-CONS LIST

   Mailing-List for SF Conventions listing update notices.

   There is a master SF cons list (averaging 1000-1500 lines or
55,000-75,000 
   characters, including geographic cross-reference) on SRI-NIC in file:
      <ZELLICH>CONS.TXT
   For ARPANET users, SRI-NIC supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS login
within 
   FTP, with any password.

   In order to proliferate the list more quickly, there is a mailing
list for 
   cons-list \update notices/.  Copies of the cons list itself are not
sent to 
   the world at large, but for those ARPANET users who seriously intend
to FTP 
   the updated versions every few weeks, a brief notice will be sent
when a new
   version is available.  For those liaisons at internet sites who
maintain or 
   redistribute copies for their own networks (DECNet, Xerox, BitNet,
MailNet, 
   etc.), the complete new file will be sent out if necessary.  File
copies 
   will \not/ be sent to individual users, either ARPANET or internet.

   Update notices/file copies can be expected approximately every 2nd or
3rd 
   month.  Sources of cons for the list are LOCUS, ANALOG, STARLOG,
flyers 
   picked up at cons by local fen, and anything sent to the list
maintainer.

   To get on the update-notices list (or to submit con updates), send
messages 
   to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>.

SF-LOVERS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Science Fiction lovers.  SF-LOVERS has discussed many topics, all of
them 
   related in some way to the theme of science fiction or fantasy.  The
topics 
   have ranged very widely from rewritten stories, bad SF movies, and SF
   conventions to reviews of books and films.  The range of topics is
quite 
   wide and anyone is welcome to submit material on these or other
topics of 
   interest in this general area.

   The digest has a very large number of readers, and trivial messages
are 
   strongly discouraged due to the heavy load SF-LOVERS puts on the
hosts CPU 
   and disk space.  Messages to SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS are batched and
broadcast 
   periodically.

   The SF-LOVERS archives are available on RUTGERS.  Each volume is
contained 
   in its own file, with the contents ordered chronologically. The first
   archive includes a number of messages from the early days before
digests and
   there is much of "historical" interest.  At the end of that volume is
a long
   discussion which took place during the Star Wars series craze.

      T:<SFL>ARCHIVE.V1      860  2200759

      For those unfamiliar with Tenex/Tops-20, the first number is the
number 
      of Tenex disk pages, the second is the number of characters in the
file, 
      for checksumming purposes if you FTP the file.  Volume 11 is the
current 
      volume A/O Jan 86.  Old issues can also be found at RUTGERS and
are in 
      the files SF-LOVERS.xxx-yy where xxx is the month of publication
and yy 
      is the current year.  The current month's messages may be found in
      PS:<BBOARD>SF-LOVERS.TXT.

SMAuG^.X@Xerox.ARPA

   Mailing list for communication of ideas about SMAuG (Simultaneous
Multiple 
   AdventUrer Game).  SMAuG is an applied research project designed to
probe 
   the problems of distributing the work of a complex piece of software
across 
   local intelligent devices and a remote timesharing computer.  The
software 
   being creating is an adventure game allowing multiple players.
Players may 
   be controlled by either human users or planning software.  The
project is 
   potentially enormous and much paring of capabilities is expected.
The 
   primary goals of the project are:

      Error free communication protocol
      Simple control of local intelligent devices
      Centralized database with local caching of unchanging data objects
      Local processing of user commands (to offload central system)
      An adventure game

   This project is an offshoot of a locally funded research grant
examining the
   interaction of local intelligent devices and remote timesharing
systems.  
   Since January 1, 1984 we have been sponsored by the Rutgers Center
for 
   Computer and Information Services.  We hope to produce software
useful to 
   other members of the University computing community with this
project.  Two 
   such pieces of software are a remote file access system, and a
universal 
   window oriented terminal handler.

   The SMAuG group meets every Wednesday evening from 8pm until 10pm at
Rutgers
   University in Hill Center room 318.  Hill Center is located on Busch
Campus 
   in Piscataway, New Jersey.  Requests for detailed directions should
be sent 
   to Fischer.PA@XEROX.ARPA.  If you are coming any distance to attend a
   meeting please contact Fischer.PA@XEROX.ARPA, sometimes the meetings
are 
   held elsewhere, and announcements of this are only distributed
locally in 
   the Rutgers area. Your attendance is, however, very welcome!

   There is a separate mailing-list for SMAuG Storywriters: 
   SMAuG-Story^.X@Xerox.ARPA; archives for this list are available from 
   Fischer.PA@Xerox.ARPA.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, back issue

UNIX-SW@SIMTEL20.ARPA

   UNIX-SW is a vehicle for announcing the availablity of new major
packages of
   UNIX/'C' language software on the SIMTEL20 repository.  This list
will also 
   be used to mail periodic updates of the list of all UNIX software
held at 
   SIMTEL20 (probably monthly).

   UNIX-SW is not a forum for discussion of this software.  Such
discussions 
   are more appropriately held with the authors, or in other groups.
Rather, 
   we are attempting to make known to the widest possible audience the
contents
   of this large repository of public-domain software.

   SIMTEL20 is a DEC-20 machine running the TOPS20 operating system,
located at
   White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.  The machine is a host on the
Defense
   Data Network (DDN), and as such, gives users located on other hosts
the 
   capability of directly transferring this software via the FTP (file
transfer
   process) command.

   Mail archives are stored on SIMTEL20 in file:
      PS:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>UNIX-SW-ARCHIV.TXT
   They are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from SIMTEL20 for those with
TCP/IP 
   access to the Internet.

Perhaps I have an idea what is wrong.  Turbo uses BIOS calls for I/O instead 
of BDOS calls, thereby bypassing the waiting SUBMIT input.  You can change this
by writing your own procedure using Turbo's BDos procedure and changing the
appropriate pointer (probably ConInPtr) to point to your procedure.  This may
be done, I THINK, by using something like ConInPtr := ptr(addr(yourproc)).
Read the Turbo 3.0 manual section on I/O drivers on page 272.  All of this comes to me because I once saw an example somewhere but oculd not put my finger on it

MMDF-Warning:  Parse error in preceding line at AMSAA.ARPA

I long ago purchased Microsoft's FORTRAN compiler for my CP/M machine.
Great compiler, but it has one annoying failure- it won't do INTEGER*4
math at all!  The most notable example of this problem:  the following
code
         INTEGER*4 I,J,K
         I=1
         J=1
         K=I/J

produces a divide by zero error!  Has anyone else out there experienced
similar problems, encountered fixes, etc?  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks!

disclaimer:  I have no commercial ties to anyone.
             The carpet is plush!

Could anyone who has used the Aztec C compiler on the Commodore

I would be interested in knowing about its ideal hardware configuration,
and also its ability on cross compiling to native 65xx and 85xx code, the
size of the object code in the 3 environments (64, 128 & CP/M) and execution
speeds.
Lastly the price and the versions available (commercial, developers, personal ?)

Thank you very much.

Is it possible to run Z-System on the Kache Systems HD64180 board?
(It plug into the Apple ][ bus and offers 256K memory, expandable to 512K
or 1 meg, parallel port, serial port, etc.)

Seems like it would be well-matched to the //GS, if multitasking under the 
Z-system will really be supported.  (Apple doesn't seem anxious to support
it on any of their machines.)

I've been using Aztec C at work for the last two years in the following
versions:

CP/M-80 commercial
Commodore 64 version (compiled on CP/M)
CP/M-80 to Appledos cross compiler with library support hacked to
support Aim-65


I'm happy with the the CP/M version (1.06D, much better than 1.05G).
This is used on the Commodore 128 in CP/M mode.  I use the compiler to
write real time control code and am satisfied with its efficiency.
There are a number of miscellenous bugs in the libraries and the
compiler occassionally does wierd things (maybe once every 3 months).
This I've found acceptable.  The compiler runs moderately fast and
produces relatively efficient code.

The Commodore 64 compiler is another story all together.  Reading
between the lines in Manx's documentation indicates it wasn't easy to
get a Unix compatible library up and running for the file system.  In
addition, a 6502 architecture presents a number of technical problems.
Manx seems to have solves them at the expense of speed and space (i.e
recursive software is supported through a software stack, there are 8
register variables on the base page, etc.).

I don't pretend to be a Commodore guru, but I wouldn't want to write
code to support the 64/128 mode.  Using only the CP/M mode, it works
like a CP/M machine.  If you want to access the hardware from a C
program there seems to be various ways to do it.

All in all, I feel Manx delivers a quality product which works.

I have often wondered how do I address a net note to someone in a different
mail domain than mine.  Well, thanks to the Oct. 1986 issue of the
Communications of the ACM, I have the answer.  On pages 932-971, 
John Quarterman & Josiah Hoskins published an article on "Notable
Computer Networks".  While it probably won't be a best seller, one of the
best parts is Table III, Address Formats and Gateways.  (The table is 
found on page 940).  The table provides a 10 domain matrix of how to
address mail from one domain to another.  The ten domains listed are:

ARPA, CSNET, MAILNET, JANET, EAN, COSAC, BITNET, ACSNET, UUCP & JUNET.

I realize that this note is not directly related to this mailing list,
however, I think with the multinet distribution of the list, I hope 
that others might find this information useful.

I would like to get hold of a copy of ZCPR3. Could some kind soul either
mail me a copy, post it on net.sources or tell me where I could acquire it?
I understand it is public domain. Is this correct.

Also, The current edition of Byte has a review of some good PD stuff for
CP/M. It would be nice if some of these appeared on the net too.

To: info-cpm@AMSAA.ARPA
Message-ID: <SAGE.28836174@LL.ARPA>

Gary Evans requested a working copy of Z-System for a BigBoard II.  The
disk operating system part of Z-System (ZRDOS) is proprietary and must be
paid for.  I suggest that anyone who wants to get Z-System running on his
CP/M-2.2 computer purchase Z-COM from Echelon.  Z-COM will install itself on
your computer automatically in a few minutes, and it costs very little more
than ZRDOS alone.  You can buy the stripped down version (without all the
utilities, which you can get from SIMTEL20 or from any of the dozens of
Z-Node remote access systems around the country) for $70.  The memory
penalty of using Z-COM rather than a manually installed version is only
512 bytes.  Once you have Z-COM running, you are not stuck with the standard
version; you can modify it.  I will be preparing a file describing some of
the details on how to do that.  Here is the info on Echelon:
 
                Echelon, Inc.
                885 N. San Antonio Road
                Los Altos, CA 94022

                415-489-9005 (modem)
 
My wife is a dealer for Echelon, but I have no financial interest in any
sales Echelon makes directly.  I just think that Z-COM is a very fine
product.  For sales, please contact them directly.  If you have technical
questions, contact either them or me.

It seems unlikely to me that the LBR files are the problem if all the other
files read all right, unless those files just happen to be stored, for
example, on the inner tracks of the diskettes while the other files are on
the outer tracks.  If you have the CRC program, you can run that on the
files to determine whether they read correctly or not.
 
The BAD DIRECTORY message suggests that something appears to be wrong with
the first sector of the files, where the LBR directory is stored.  The memory
error message may be related to the same thing.  But I cannot see how aligning
the drives would have anything to do with such a problem.  There are various
useful diagnostics that could be performed (with DU, disk utility, for
example), but that would be hard enough locally and impossible long distance.
 
Another way to check the LBR files would be to copy them to a new diskette.
If you use the PIP verify option (PIP B:=A:NAME.LBR[V]) the file will be
copied and checked.  If the source diskette is unreadable, you will get a
BDOS error message (BAD SECTOR).  If you did not suggest that LU and LDIR
as well as NULU complain about the LBR files, I would think that something
happened to your copy of NULU.
 
If the files seem to be all right but still do not work, I would suspect that
something has gone wrong with the correspondence between the disk directory
(and its sector allocations for the files) and the actual file allocations.
But such a problem would make a lot of the COM files fail to operate.
 
I'm not sure what else to suggest to you.  Good luck.  If you really get
desperate and want to send me a diskette, I would be willing to take a look
at it and try to figure out what happened.  You can reach me at MIT Lincoln
Lab, PO Box 73, Lexington, MA 02173-0073.

Subject: merging two text files

I'm looking for a program similar to PASTE that will take two text
files and turn them into one file of two column.  Paste would do it,
except that the alignment of the second column is dependent on the
line width of the first column.  Thus, the program would have to take
a couple of additional inputs specifying how wide to make each file.

Thanks..

Subject: Microsoft's FORTRAN product

I, too, have found the Microsoft's FORTRAN compiler very limited in its
ability to cope with INTEGER*4 values.  Add and subtract seem to work
and division by an INTEGER*2....  Call a built-in function like MIN0
or MOD--don't bother.

I have been more frustrated by its incompleteness in the I/O area.
Create a data file with the editor; save it on disk.  Now, try to read
it with a FORTRAN program.  Every input record except the first has an
extraneous line-feed for its first byte.  However, if your first format
item is a numeric, the I/O support quitely strips the line-feed!  Ask
for character data first, and you get the bogus line-feed.  On the
other hand, if you write formated data to a disk file and then try to
type or edit the result, it's one long line since no line-feeds got
inserted after each carriage return.

My final solution to the disk I/O problem was to modify the disk I/O
driver provided in source by Microsoft.  My change was simply to
insert linefeeds along with the carriage return at end-of-record
during formated disk writes, and to skip linefeeds during formated
disk reads.  Not perfect, but the behavior is much more reasonable
now.

However, I suspect there are a fair number of us who use an
intermediate host system between the source and the micro. I, for
example, am using a UNIX VAX as a staging area for software that I am
interested in. Becuase of the small size of the disks on my micro, I
cannot download everything and review it there convienently...

Andre - Here is a 144kb listing of all the interest groups.  Your
guess about isib and b.isi is correct.  The new domain naming convention
is the b.isi.  The difference between info-ibmpc and info-ibmpc-request
is that request is the address used to get on the list.  Your return
address of UZ32112%BLIULG12.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU is correct.
All I can suggest is that you can try sending a request to the request
address and ask for confirmation of your request to be added to the
list.

I'll send the two most recent info-ibmpc digests as separate notes.

EVOLUTION@KESTREL

   This direct-distribution mailing list is organized to discuss
consequences 
   of the theory of evolution, with emphasis on mathematics, on computer
   simulations, and on literature.  While creationists in this group are
   expected to be few in number, and while they may not reasonably
expect to be
   taken seriously unless they can introduce radically better evidence
than 
   creationists have in the past, we have no agreement to limit
discussion of 
   contraversal topics.  The coordinator assumes no responsibility for
opinions
   expressed in the group or for misuse.

   Archives are available only upon request to
EVOLUTION-REQUEST@KESTREL.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

HUMAN-NETS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Mailing list originally consisting of the combined memberships of 
   INFO-PCNET, HOME-SAT, and TELETEXT mailing lists.  Human-Nets has
discussed 
   many topics, all of them related in some way to the theme of a
world-wide 
   computer and telecommunications network usually called WorldNet.  The
topics
   have ranged very widely, from something like tutorials, to state of
the art 
   discussions, to rampant speculation about technology and its impact.
The 
   list is extremely large, making it necessary to batch messages sent
to the 
   list and distributing them once each day during off peak periods to
avoid 
   overloading the system.

   The permanent archives contain all of the material distributed to the
list. 
   Due to size, this archive is broken down into several different
files, 
   stored in reverse temporal order.  The files are currently stored on
ARPANet
   host RU-BLUE in files RHYTHM:<PLEASANT.HUMAN-NETS>HUMNET.* (where "*"
is a 
   wild-card).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

INFO-1100@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU
BUG-1100@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU

   These discussion lists focus on Xerox 1100 workstations (1100, 1108,
1132, 
   1185, 1186) and protocols.  Their purpose is to stimulate
communication and 
   sharing between computer science research groups that are using or
are 
   interested in these machines.

   Info-1100 is the "information channel" where messages such as
announcements 
   of available lispusers packages may be made or for queries such as
"Does 
   anybody know of a PUP file server implementation for the Sinclair
ZX-80?".  
   It is intended to be a low-volume list suitable for the casual
reader.  
   Bug-1100 is the "bug channel" where readers can warn others of
Interlisp-D 
   bugs and/or suggest workarounds or solicit help or discussion; it is 
   expected to have greater volume than Info-1100, being for the
hard-core 
   user.  Since hard-core users read both lists, Bug-1100 is a subset of
   Info-1100 and there is never a need to send to both lists.

   Xerox PARC, SIS, and AIS people are included in the distribution list
to 
   facilitate communication about new developments, bugs, performance
issues, 
   etc..  Additionally, Info-1100 and Bug-1100 are automatically
forwarded to 
   AISupport.pasa@Xerox, where bugs are noted and acted upon if
appropriate. 
   Xerox AIS employees will not respond in Bug-1100 unless the reply is
of 
   general interest or silence would mislead the readership.

   Archives of messages are kept on SUMEX-AIM in files:
      <BBOARD>INFO-1100.TXT      <BBOARD>BUG-1100.TXT
   Some net-contributed lispusers packages, updates, and patches are
kept on 
   SUMEX-AIM in files:
      <LISPUSERS.INTERMEZZO>      <LISPUSERS.KOTO>      etc.

   Requests to be added to or deleted from these lists, problems,
questions, 
   etc. should be sent to Info-1100-Request@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU or 
   Bug-1100-Request@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU.

INFO-FUTURES%BU-CS@CSNet-Relay.ARPA
      INFO-FUTURES@BU-CS (CSNET)
      ...harvard!bu-cs!info-futures (UUCP)

   Digest to provide a speculative forum for analyzing current and
likely 
   events in technology as they will affect our near future in computing
and 
   related areas.  In broad terms, topics of interest include
developments in 
   both computing research and industry which are likely to affect our
decision
   making, particularly decisions we are probably grappling with right
this 
   minute.  Technologies can change so rapidly that simply forecasting
for 
   needs within any organization one or two years in advance can be
extremely 
   difficult, frequently we are forced to provide foundations that
effectively 
   lock us into a technology for longer periods of time. It is hoped the
   information this list provides can help both the practitioner and
researcher
   determine where best to expend resources.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to INFO-FUTURES-REQUEST%BU-CS@CSNet-Relay.ARPA.

INFO-IBMPC@USC-ISIB

   Info-IBMPC is a forum for technical discussion of the IBM Personal
Computer 
   and compatible micro-computers, providing a way for interested
members of 
   the ARPANET community to compare notes, ask questions, and share
insights of
   a technical nature about these machines.  While it is not primarily a
   consumer's guide to the IBM PC, the digest may also be useful for
that 
   purpose.

   Messages are collected, edited into digests and distributed as the
volume of
   mail dictates (generally twice a week).  All messages of a technical
nature 
   about IBM PCs are welcomed; messages about other topics will not be
run.  In
   addition, two topics are taboo and are routinely edited out: (1) self
   promotion of products for sale, and (2) anything about copy
protection.

   Recent digests are archived on USC-ISIB in <INFO-IBMPC>DIGESTS-85.
Older 
   digests are archived by quarter in the following files:

      Q1-DIGESTS-85   ; V4 # 1-40 [too big for mm, use hermes]
      Q4-DIGESTS-84   ; V3 # 91-119

      Q1-DIGESTS-83   ; V2 # 1-19
      Q34-DIGESTS-82  ; V1 # 1-34

      These files can be read by MM, HERMES, and other TOPS20 mail
systems. 
      KWIC-INDEX.TXT contains a key-word-in-context index to digest
articles.  
      TOC.???85 contains a table of contents for the month ???. These
files may
      be FTP'ed to any Arpanet/Milnet host from [USC-ISIB]<INFO-IBMPC>
by 
      logging in within FTP using username ANONYMOUS, password GUEST.
If 
      you're not directly on the Arpanet the files can be mailed to you,
      although there is a limit to the length of a message.

   A library of free software is maintained in [USC-ISIB]<INFO-IBMPC>.
The 
   list of available programs is in <INFO-IBMPC>PROGRAM-LIBRARY.LIST.
Donations
   of source code are eagerly welcomed (even trivial programs). Donated 
   programs must be truly free, with no fee or contribution required or

INFO-KERMIT@CU20B

   Kermit is a file transfer protocol for use primarily between micros
and 
   mainframes over TTY lines, and is implemented on a wide variety of
both. The
   Info-Kermit mailing list is a digest intended for people who maintain
or 
   install Kermit at their sites, or who are (thinking about) working on
a new 
   implementation, or who have bugs and/or fixes to report, or who are 
   interested in discussing the protocol; it is available on Internet,
CSnet, 
   Mailnet, BITnet, Usenet, CCnet, and any other network gatewayed to
the 
   Internet.

   All the Kermit files are on CU20B in the area "KER:" or "K2:".  The
file 
   KER:AAAREAD.ME contains information on what files are in the Kermit 
   distribution area and how to find them.  One file worth checking from
time 
   to time is KER:AAVNEW.HLP, a brief tabular listing of each existing
version 
   of Kermit, showing the version number and date of the latest release
of each
   version.  The file KER:AANETW.HLP lists in detail the procedures for 
   obtaining Kermit files via network.

   Kermit files, including program source and documentation, are
available as 
   follows:

      Internet: anonymous FTP from host CU20B, area KER: or K2:, 24
hours a 
      day, 7 days a week.

      BITnet: from the KERMSRV server at host CUVMA; type SMSG RSCS MSG
CUVMA 
      KERMSRV HELP for further information.

      UUCP: from Oklahoma State University (host okstate) in Stillwater,
OK. 
      Mail to uucp-support%okstate@CSNET-RELAY for further information. 
      Selected sources (usually Unix-related) are posted to net.sources
from 
      time to time.

      CCNET: DECnet NFT from host CU20B.  Anonymous NFT connections are
not 
      permitted from all hosts, so file transfers must be made by system
      managers or programmers who have access to CU20B.

      U.S. Mail: send requests for information to:

         Kermit Distribution
         Columbia University Center for Computing Activities
         612 West 115 Street
         New York, NY  10025

   Info-Kermit mail was direct up until May 23, 1984, when it became a
digest. 
   The pre-digest messages are in KER:MAIL.83A and KER:MAIL.84A.  Volume
1 of 
   the digest is in KER:MAIL.84B.  The current, active digest is in 
   KER:MAIL.TXT.  From time to time, active digests will be retired to
files 
   with names like KER:MAIL.85A, KER:MAIL.85B, and so on.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions,

files:

      "PS:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>MICRO.ARCHIV.ymmdd"  is a group of files
containing 
      correspondence going back several years.  The characters "ymmdd"
in the 
      file names are actually digits giving the year, month and day of
the last
      message in each particular file.
"PS:<ARCHIVES.MICRO>MICRO-ARCHIV.TXT" 
      contains a growing archive of current correspondence.

      Over 80 megabytes of public domain software (most of it CP/M) are

GOTO), 
   separate compilation with a module (compilation unit) broken into 
   specification and implementation parts with importing and exporting
of 
   objects, controlled machine level access, and concurrent programming
and 
   coroutines.  Modula-2 has most of the power of Ada but is small
enough that 
   excellent full implementations exist for CP/M 80.

   Mail archives are stored on SIMTEL20 in file:
      <ARCHIVES.MODULA-2>MODULA-2-ARCHIV.TXT
   They are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from SIMTEL20 for those with

INFO-PCNET@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

   INFO-PCNET is a general mailing list to keep interested people
advised of 
   major developments.

   PCNET is a volunteer effort creating a computer network for personal
use. 
   Although meant to be device independent, the current design is
oriented to 
   use through the telephone system, particularly by computers with
automatic 
   dialing and receipt of calls.  PCNET will enable all computer users,
whether
   part of a formal network organization or individual owners of
personal 
   computers, to communicate with each other effectively.  PCNET is
defining 
   communication protocols that assure that transmissions are correct 
   (retransmitting data that is lost or erroneous), and which allow
multiple 
   logical data streams so that several programs can share a single
hardware 
   communication link.  PCNET has defined a worldwide addressing
standard that 
   permits automatic forwarding of messages and files without having to
know 
   the topology of the network.

   PCNET is currently finising software on several machines (8080, 6502,
   PDP-10) using several languages (Assembly language, LISP, C), and
refining 
   the documentation; volunteer communications programmers are needed to
   complete these tasks.

   The PCNET files are on SIMTEL20 in directory PD:<PCNET>.  SIMTEL20
supports 
   ANONYMOUS login within FTP them using any non-null password.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

INFO-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.ARPA
BUG-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.ARPA

   The INFO-TMODEM list is a means for the maintainer of the TMODEM
program to 
   send notices to users of TMODEM.  Users of TMODEM send bug reports
and 
   feature requests to BUG-TMODEM@SIMTEL20.

   TMODEM is a new TOPS-20 implementation of the Christensen Protocol,
with all
   the latest features, such as:
      o  wildcard file transfers in the style of MODEM7
         (YMODEM batch is coming)
      o  the YMODEM implementation of the K option with a new algorithm
         to return to K mode after falling back to "normal" mode
      o  extensive built-in HELP for all commands and options.
   TMODEM is an amalgamation of the old TOPS-20 MODEM program,
originally 
   written by Bill Westfield while he was at SRI and now at Stanford,
major 
   pieces of the TOPS-20 TELNET program, currently maintained by Mark
Crispin, 
   and some pieces of code stolen from TTLINK and KERMIT-20 by Frank da
Cruz at
   Columbia University.

   The archives for replaced mailing list INFO-MODEMXX are frozen in 
   <ARCHIVES.MODEMXX> on SIMTEL20.  A new set of archives for
INFO-TMODEM is on
   SIMTEL20 in <ARCHIVES.TMODEM>TMODEM-ARCHIV.TXT.  The source for
TMODEM is in
   TOPS-20:TMODEM.MAC, and must be compiled for each individual TOPS-20
system 
   environment.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to INFO-TMODEM-REQUEST@SIMTEL20.ARPA.

   Coordinator: Frank J. Wancho <WANCHO@SIMTEL20.ARPA>

INFO-UNIX@BRL.ARPA

   INFO-UNIX is intended for Question/Answer discussion, where "novice"
system 
   administrators can pose questions.  Also, much of the discussion of
UNIX on 
   small (micro) computers may be moved from INFO-MICRO, INFO-CPM, etc.,
into 
   INFO-UNIX.  Hopefully, enough people who know some answers will
subscribe so
   that the list serves a purpose; some overlap is expected with the 
   UNIX-WIZARDS list.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to INFO-UNIX-REQUEST@BRL.ARPA.

   Moderator: Mike Muuss <mike@BRL.ARPA>

reached 
   through them and are certainly urged to participate).

   There is no objection to distributing material that is destined for 
   conference proceedings or any other publication.  The Coordinator is 
   involved in SIGIR Forum and, unless submittors request otherwise, may
   include submissions in whole or in part in future paper versions of
the 
   FORUM.  Indeed, this is one form of solicitation for FORUM
contributions!  
   Both IRList and the FORUM are unrefereed, and opinions are always
those of 
   the author and not of any organization unless there are other
indications.  
   Copies of list items should credit the original author, not
necessarily the 
   IRList.

   Archival copies of all digests will be kept; feel free to ask
IRList-Request
   for recent back issues.  Note that FTP is not possible, so all
communication
   must be by EMAIL, phone, or letter.

LIST OF MAILING LISTS

   Mailing-list for "List of lists" update notices.

   There is a master list of ARPANET mailing-lists/digests/discussion
groups 
   (~140 lists/2600+ lines/120,000+ characters) on SRI-NIC in files:
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-1.TXT  (first half of the list)
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-2.TXT  (second half of the list)
      For ARPANET users, SRI-NIC supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS
      login within FTP, with any password.

   To keep people up to date on the large number of such lists, there is
a 
   mailing-list for list-of-lists \update notices/.  Copies of the list
itself 
   are not sent to the world at large, but for those ARPANET users who 
   seriously intend to FTP the updated versions when updated, a brief
notice 
   will be sent when a new version is available.  For those liaisons at 
   internet sites who maintain or redistribute copies for their own
networks 
   (DECNet, Xerox, BitNet, MailNet, etc.) and can't reach the master by
ARPANET
   FTP, the complete new file will be sent if necessary.  File copies
will not 
   normally be sent to individual users, either ARPANET or internet.

   To get on the list (or to submit updates to existing mailing-lists or
add 
   new ones), send requests to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>

   A QZCOM conference with the name "MHS (X.400) implementation"; the 
   conference will have the name "MHS_(X.400)_implementation" for mail 
   networks, in most cases postfixed  by "%QZCOM@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA".  The
   conference/mailing list is open to anyone who is seriously interested
in  
   implementing the CCITT X.400 (MHS) message handling protocols or
gateways to
   these protocols.  The conference/mailing list can discuss such things
as how
   to understand and interpret the MHS recommendation, how to map
existing mail
   system and mail network features onto the MHS structure etc.

   To minimize international communications costs, separate distribution
lists 
   for CSNET/ARPANET and CDNNET users are being maintained at UWISC and
UBC 
   respectively.  ARPANET and CSNET users should send messages to 
   MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@WISC-RSCH.  CDNNET users should send messages to 
   MHS_IMPLEMENTATION@EAN.UBC.CDN.  Messages sent to one of the lists
will be 
   forwarded to members of the other lists.

   To join the conference:
      QZCOM users:
         Use the "member" command.
      ARPANET/CSNET users:
         Send a message to  MHS_IMPLEMENTATION-REQUEST@RSCH.WISC.EDU

   A forum for discussion of Military Simulation and Wargaming Models
used by, 
   and for the Department of Defense.  This list will eventually augment
the 
   online Catalog of Wargaming and Military Simulation Models under
development
   on STL-HOST1.  Messages are not digested, but sent to the membership
as 
   received.

   Archives will be kept on SIMTEL20 in files:
      PS:<MAIL.ARCHIVES>MILSIM.ARCHIV.ymmdd
      PS:<MAIL.ARCHIVES>MILSIM.ARCHIV.TXT

      The characters "ymmdd" in the first filename are actually digests
giving 
      the year, month, and day of the last message in the file.  The
second 
      file contains a growing list of current messages.  SIMTEL20
supports 
      ANONYMOUS FTP (with any non-null password).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to MILSIM-REQUEST@STL-HOST1.ARPA.

MMM-PEOPLE@USC-ISIB

   Discussion group for those active or interested in multimedia mail.
The 
   intent is to use this list mainly for discussion of the developing 
   multimedia mail procedures and protocols.

   The mail sent to MMM-PEOPLE is kept on host USC-ISIB in file
<MMM>MAIL.TXT. 
   The distribution list is kept in file <MMM>MMM-PEOPLE.LIST.  A list
of all 
   known multi-media-capable users is in file
<MMM>KNOWN-MMM-MAILBOXES.TXT.  
   One may copy these public access files via FTP using the username

music-research%prg.oxford.ac.uk@CS.UCL.AC.UK

   The Music-Research electronic mail redistribution list was
established after
   a suggestion made at a meeting in Oxford in July 1986, to provide an 
   effective and fast means of bringing together musicologists, music
analysts,
   computer scientists, and others working on applications of computers
in 
   music research.  Initially, the list was established for people whose
chief 
   interests concern computers and their applications to

      - music representation systems
      - information retrieval systems for musical scores
      - music printing
      - music analysis
      - musicology and ethnomusicology
      - tertiary music education
      - databases of musical information

   The following areas are not the principal concern of this list,
although 
   overlapping subjects may well be interesting:

      - primary and secondary education
      - sound generation techniques
      - composition

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions,

NAMEDROPPERS@SRI-NIC.ARPA

   The NAMEDROPPERS mailing list is to be used for discussion of the
concepts, 
   principles, design, and implementation of the domain style names.
The main 
   focus of this group is the review of documents describing domain
style 
   names.  This is a list for participants in a discussion, not
observers.  
   Everyone on the list is expected to contribute from time to time.

   Nearly everyone in NAMEDROPPERS is also on HEADER-PEOPLE and also on 
   MSGGROUP.  There is no need to send a message to both NAMEDROPPERS
and 
   either of these lists (and certianly not both!).

   All of the previous NAMEDROPPERS discussion can be found in SRI-NIC
files
      <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.198X
   where X is the number of the year of the archive you are looking for.
A/O 
   Jan 85, there are archives for 1983, 1984 and 1985.  
   <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.MAIL still contains the most current
NAMEDROPPERS 
   dialog.  These files can be accessed via anonymous FTP; new members
may wish
   to copy and read these archives before joining the discussion.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to NAMEDROPPERS-REQUEST@SRI-NIC.

   Coordinator: Ann Westine <WESTINE@USC-ISIB.ARPA>

NIHONGO@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

   For discussion of the Japanese language, including both spoken and
written 
   forms.  Also see the entry for the INFO-JAPAN mailing list.

   The complete archives are publicly accessible by FTP from host
MIT-MC, which
   uses the ITS operating system.  Case is not significant, but the
space after
   "NIHON" is.  The archives are in:  COMAIL;NIHON GO

NL-KR@ROCHESTER.ARPA

   NL-KR is open to discussion of any topic related to the natural
language 
   (both understanding and generation) and knowledge representation,
both as 
   subfields of AI.  The Moderator's interests are primarily in:

      Knowledge Representation    Natural Language Understanding
      Discourse Understanding     Philosophy of Language
      Plan Recognition            Computational Linguistics

   Contributions are also welcome on topics such as:

      Cognitive Psychology (as related to NL/KR)
      Human Perception (same)
      Linguistics
      Machine Translation
      Computer and Information Science (as may be used to implement
various
      Logic Programming (same)                                   NL
systems)

   Contributions may be anything from tutorials to speculation. In
particular, 
   the following are sought:

      Abstracts                             Reviews
      Lab Descriptions                      Research Overviews
      Work Planned or in Progress           Half-Baked Ideas
      Conference Announcements              Conference Reports
      Bibliographies                        History of NL/KR
      Puzzles and Unsolved Problems         Anecdotes, Jokes, and Poems
      Queries and Requests                  Address Changes (Bindings)

   This list is in some sense a spin-off of the AIList, and as such, a
certain 
   amount of overlap is expected. The primary concentration of this list
should
   be NL and KR, that is, natural language (be it understanding,
generation, 
   recognition, parsing, semantics, pragmatics, etc.) and how we should 
   represent knowledge (aquisition, access, completeness, etc. are all
valid 
   issues).  Topics deemed to be outside the general scope of this list
will be
   forwarded to AIList (or other more appropriate list) or rejected.

   Archival copies of all digests will be kept; feel free to ask
NL-KR-REQUEST 
   for recent back issues.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to NL-KR-REQUEST@ROCHESTER.ARPA.

POLI-SCI@RUTGERS

   POLI-SCI is a spinoff from the HUMAN-NETS discussion list.  Shortly
after 
   the November 1980 election, HUMAN-NETS began to discuss the impact
that 
   electronic communications had on the election.  As this discussion 
   continued, it lost its narrow focus on electronic communications and
began 
   to consider the election in general, how elections are won and lost,
and the
   nature of the electoral college.  The growth of these discussions,
and their
   spawning of related discussions, indicated that a separate discussion
list 
   was merited and POLI-SCI was installed.  Since then POLI-SCI has
begun to 
   consider other topics including the history of the Carter and Nixon 
   presidencies, the Iranian hostage crisis, etc. (with a little less
dignity, 
   the list might be characterized as a permanent distributed political
bull 
   session).

   Archived digest messages are stored on RUTGERS in:
      <poli-sci>mail.txt
      and other files in the <poli-sci> directory

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

PROLOG[-HACKERS]@SU-SCORE

   Prolog and logic programming mailing lists.

   Some of the people answering the initial BBoard message stated that
they 
   would be interested in general Prolog and logic programming
information, but
   not in the nitty-gritty details of Prolog systems and their bugs.
Therefore,
   two mailing lists have been set up, PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS: PROLOG
will 
   provide a digest of articles of general interest; PROLOG-HACKERS will
   provide a direct mailing for the nasty stuff.  Finally,
PROLOG-REQUEST 
   should be used for distribution requests.  In a nutshell:

      Mail to                 for
      -------                 ---

      PROLOG@SCORE            sending articles of general interest 
      PROLOG-HACKERS@SCORE    sending articles of limited interest 
      PROLOG-REQUEST@SCORE    getting in and out of the mailing lists
                               and other bureaucracy

   Please do not send the same message to PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS.
Messages 
   will be moved between lists if appropriate.

   An archive of the USEnet prolog interest group interchange can be
FTP'd from
   host SU-SCORE using standard anonymous login convention.  The
pathname is:

protocol 
   for FTP.

   Message log/archives are kept at RUTGERS in files:

Psychnet <EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU>

   PSYCHNET (tm) is a psychology Newsletter and mailing list, sending
out 
   information, news, and academic papers to those who sign up.  An
initial 
   formal purpose of Psychnet is distribution of academic papers in
advance of 
   the 1986 APA convention; other purposes will develop according to the
needs 
   and interests of the profession and Psychnet users.

   Outside BitNet, Psychnet is a Newsletter and mailing list only.  Once
per 
   week, members receive the latest Psychnet Newsletter and Index of
files 
   available on the server machine.  If a file looks interesting send an
E-mail
   request to EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU and the file will
be sent 
   to you.

   Within BitNet, Psychnet is also a 24-hour server machine which mails
out 
   files to users who first send the PSYCHNET HELP command to userid
UH-INFO at
   node UHUPVM1 (*NOT* to userid EPSYNET).  Persons within BitNet may
also sign
   up for the mailing list and will get the Newsletter and Index along
with 
   other news.  BitNet users, however, should get their files directly
from the
   server machine; an Exec file is available for CMS users and COM files
are 
   available for VAX users within BitNet.

   To have a file or idea distributed to members of the list send it to
the

  ...ihnp4!utah-cs!scribe-hacks (uucp)

   Mailing list for Scribe hackers; designed for persons who perform the
role 
   of Scribe Database Administrator at their installation.  Discussion
will be 
   about Scribe features, bugs, enhancements, performance, support, and
other 
   topics of interest to Scribe DBAs.  The list will NOT be moderated,
but will
   simply consist of a mail "reflector" - ie. if you send a message to
the 
   list, it will be rebroadcast to everyone on the list.  Discussion at
the 
   level of "How do I get a paragraph to indent 5 spaces instead of 3?"
is 
   specifically discouraged.

SECURITY@RUTGERS

   This list is designed to provide a forum for discussion of the field
of 
   security in general, be it electronic, physical, or computer-related.
Since
   the original idea was to name this list LOCKSMITHS, discussions about
   physical security and hardware are welcomed, but to broaden out into 
   computer security and electronic access control and such is also
valid.  In 
   other words, any subject matter relating to the *improvement* and 
   *implementation* of security systems is okay, while how to *defeat*
them is 
   not.  Messages are not digestified, but are filtered to keep things
of 
   questionable legality/ content from escaping out to the network.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
questions, 
   etc., should be sent to SECURITY-REQUEST@RUTGERS.

   Coordinator: *Hobbit* <AWalker@RUTGERS>

SF-CONS LIST

   Mailing-List for SF Conventions listing update notices.

   There is a master SF cons list (averaging 1000-1500 lines or
55,000-75,000 
   characters, including geographic cross-reference) on SRI-NIC in file:
      <ZELLICH>CONS.TXT
   For ARPANET users, SRI-NIC supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS login
within 
   FTP, with any password.

   In order to proliferate the list more quickly, there is a mailing
list for 
   cons-list \update notices/.  Copies of the cons list itself are not
sent to 
   the world at large, but for those ARPANET users who seriously intend
to FTP 
   the updated versions every few weeks, a brief notice will be sent
when a new
   version is available.  For those liaisons at internet sites who
maintain or 
   redistribute copies for their own networks (DECNet, Xerox, BitNet,
MailNet, 
   etc.), the complete new file will be sent out if necessary.  File
copies 
   will \not/ be sent to individual users, either ARPANET or internet.

   Update notices/file copies can be expected approximately every 2nd or
3rd 
   month.  Sources of cons for the list are LOCUS, ANALOG, STARLOG,
flyers 
   picked up at cons by local fen, and anything sent to the list
maintainer.

   To get on the update-notices list (or to submit con updates), send
messages 
   to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>.

SF-LOVERS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Science Fiction lovers.  SF-LOVERS has discussed many topics, all of
them 
   related in some way to the theme of science fiction or fantasy.  The
topics 
   have ranged very widely from rewritten stories, bad SF movies, and SF
   conventions to reviews of books and films.  The range of topics is
quite 
   wide and anyone is welcome to submit material on these or other
topics of 
   interest in this general area.

   The digest has a very large number of readers, and trivial messages
are 
   strongly discouraged due to the heavy load SF-LOVERS puts on the
hosts CPU 
   and disk space.  Messages to SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS are batched and
broadcast 
   periodically.

   The SF-LOVERS archives are available on RUTGERS.  Each volume is
contained 
   in its own file, with the contents ordered chronologically. The first
   archive includes a number of messages from the early days before
digests and
   there is much of "historical" interest.  At the end of that volume is
a long
   discussion which took place during the Star Wars series craze.

      T:<SFL>ARCHIVE.V1      860  2200759

      For those unfamiliar with Tenex/Tops-20, the first number is the
number 
      of Tenex disk pages, the second is the number of characters in the
file, 
      for checksumming purposes if you FTP the file.  Volume 11 is the
current 
      volume A/O Jan 86.  Old issues can also be found at RUTGERS and
are in 
      the files SF-LOVERS.xxx-yy where xxx is the month of publication
and yy 
      is the current year.  The current month's messages may be found in
      PS:<BBOARD>SF-LOVERS.TXT.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

SMAuG^.X@Xerox.ARPA

   Mailing list for communication of ideas about SMAuG (Simultaneous
Multiple 
   AdventUrer Game).  SMAuG is an applied research project designed to
probe 
   the problems of distributing the work of a complex piece of software
across 
   local intelligent devices and a remote timesharing computer.  The
software 
   being creating is an adventure game allowing multiple players.
Players may 
   be controlled by either human users or planning software.  The
project is 
   potentially enormous and much paring of capabilities is expected.
The 
   primary goals of the project are:

      Error free communication protocol
      Simple control of local intelligent devices
      Centralized database with local caching of unchanging data objects
      Local processing of user commands (to offload central system)
      An adventure game

   This project is an offshoot of a locally funded research grant
examining the
   interaction of local intelligent devices and remote timesharing
systems.  
   Since January 1, 1984 we have been sponsored by the Rutgers Center
for 
   Computer and Information Services.  We hope to produce software
useful to 
   other members of the University computing community with this
project.  Two 
   such pieces of software are a remote file access system, and a
universal 
   window oriented terminal handler.

   The SMAuG group meets every Wednesday evening from 8pm until 10pm at
Rutgers
   University in Hill Center room 318.  Hill Center is located on Busch
Campus 
   in Piscataway, New Jersey.  Requests for detailed directions should
be sent 
   to Fischer.PA@XEROX.ARPA.  If you are coming any distance to attend a
   meeting please contact Fischer.PA@XEROX.ARPA, sometimes the meetings
are 
   held elsewhere, and announcements of this are only distributed
locally in 
   the Rutgers area. Your attendance is, however, very welcome!

   There is a separate mailing-list for SMAuG Storywriters: 
   SMAuG-Story^.X@Xerox.ARPA; archives for this list are available from 
   Fischer.PA@Xerox.ARPA.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, back issue
requests, 
   problems, questions, etc., should be sent to McGrew.Smaug@RU-BLUE.

will also 
   be used to mail periodic updates of the list of all UNIX software
held at 
   SIMTEL20 (probably monthly).

   UNIX-SW is not a forum for discussion of this software.  Such
discussions 
   are more appropriately held with the authors, or in other groups.
Rather, 
   we are attempting to make known to the widest possible audience the
contents
   of this large repository of public-domain software.

   SIMTEL20 is a DEC-20 machine running the TOPS20 operating system,
located at
   White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.  The machine is a host on the
Defense
   Data Network (DDN), and as such, gives users located on other hosts
the 
   capability of directly transferring this software via the FTP (file
transfer
   process) command.

   Mail archives are stored on SIMTEL20 in file:
      PS:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>UNIX-SW-ARCHIV.TXT
   They are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from SIMTEL20 for those with
TCP/IP 
   access to the Internet.

Subj: Re. Why do UUDECODE etc on VAX and not on CPM system.

In regard to the question: why not deARC and uudecode on your CP/M system
instead of on the VAX with the new version of UUDECODE etc?

For my system, we have a VAX 780 from which I download the files to an
XT compatable using UNIFORM on the compatable to write on the disk in a
format that I can read on my computer at home. The process of uudecoding
etc happens to be a couple of hundred times faster on the VAX than my PC!!!
So doing it here saves me a lot of time, not to mention all the extra
ware and tare on my disk drive at home.   It works for me!!!!    Brian.

Fellow CP/Mers - By error, one of our readers posted to the whole list a
message of over 145 thousand characters.  This message has caused rather
extraordinary results: reject messages are pouring in from all over.  One
particularly strange result is that, for some reason, the message seems to be
relentlessly looping between AMSAA and XEROX.  I have written to the XEROX
Postmaster about it, and I have also set up an intercept mailbox for all
incoming info-cpm mail.  If that bugger comes around again, I'll zap it!
Sorry for the inconvenience.  Please endure.  I'll get it killed.

I've just added a StarCard to my //e, and it's causing the //e to go bonkers 
when CTRL-openapple-RESET is pressed to reboot, regardless of whether CP/M or 
Apple activity was in progress.  The machine starts writing garbage all
through the hi-res screen, and it begins a high-pitched whistle through the
speaker, like a TV horizontal oscillator gone bananas.  If I then press
CTRL-RESET, the machine will reboot.  The SoftCard I took out did not cause
this anomaly. 

Any ideas?

Please forget you ever read my previous message about trouble with a StarCard 
in my Apple //e.  I took the card out and the machine still failed - I took 
the time to reseat all the chips and cables, and the problem went away - it 
was apparently a poor connection in the keyboard cable.

There is a program called ZIP which concatenates up to seven input files
on a line-by-line basis.  I have not used it personally, but it is in the
library of BAKUP (Bay Area Kaypro Users and Programmers) who got it from
ONKUG, the Kaypro Corp. user's group disk newsletter some time ago.  If
you are interested in more info you can send me a message or write to me
at BAKUP Library, 412 61st St., Oakland, CA 94609.  Disks from our library
are only available to members ($10 per year, mail order disks $7.50 each), 
but if you send me a disk in a reusable mailer I will copy thaT LBR file and
return it to you.

Hi, fellow CP/Mers and IBM PCers.

This is a followup to a request I made a couple weeks ago.  I had
asked for help in getting 8-inch CP/M format disks working on my
IBM PC.  Since I got a number of requests for copies of whatever
I learned, here's my summary.

To review, what I had was an IBM PC, a Maynard floppy disk controller
card which supports both 8" and 5.25" drives, and some low
level driver software. I needed the software that knows about
CP/M file structure and that would play with the above pieces.

I received one message that suggested I could do it the other way around,
namely write 8" MS-DOS files and then use one of the variants of
SWEEP that could read the MS-DOS disk on my CP/M machine.  This wasn't
what I wanted, and I didn't pursue that path. It might work - I don't know.

Bill Wells at opal.berkeley.edu gave me a pointer to Xenocopy-PC,
by Fred Cisim at Xenosoft in Berkeley, CA.  I called Fred and he
said he hoped to get that format done soon but didn't have it yet.
But he told me that he had a couple competitors who had done it,
and gave me their phone numbers! Now THAT's being HELPFUL!!!
So Thanks, Fred!

I wound up getting Uniform-PC from Micro Solutions, Inc. in
DeKalb Illinois. (There are two companies by that name.)
Uniform-PC did the trick and is actually pretty neat.  It isn't
just the usual "copy from here to there" conversion program. It
integrates the foreign (CP/M) disk into the MS-DOS environment.
You can run a compilation on the IBM PC under MS-DOS with the
listing output pointed at the CP/M disk and it will write it as a
CP/M file. You don't have to write it as a MS-DOS file and then
perform a separate conversion step to get it into CP/M format.
There would be cases where this would be a real neat feature, on
5" CP/M disks as well as 8".

Uniform-PC does all the low level stuff too, formating, setting
disk parameters, etc. The driver I bought from Floppy Disk Services
was a waste of $50.  It was written by Flagstaff Engineering. It came
with totally inadequate documentation, had no parameter setting
program for step rate, for example, and was basically useless.
When I called Flagstaff to ask a couple questions I was told
very bluntly that I would have to ask my questions through my dealer.

So in summary, I have a good working solution with my 8" drive
and controller (Siemens or Shugart drive, Maynard controller) from
FDSI and Uniform-PC from Micro Solutions. Uniform-PC costs $70.

Standard disclaimers. Everything is copyrighted/trademarked.
I have no financial interest in any of the above.

_THE_ S-100 bus definition is the ANSI/IEEE Std 696-1983,
write to IEEE Inc., 345 East 47th Street, NY, NY  10017.
I think it cost about $10 or so, depends if you are an IEEE
or not.  Definately worthwhile, some of the terminology is
a bit unusual and hard to follow, but read it a few times and
you will get the idea.  This is the spec for the S-100 bus,
so it's _all_ here.

Has anyone gotten any version of ZCPR working on a DEC VT180 (Robin)?
I know about EZCPR, and I'd like to upgrade to the *REAL THING*.

Thanks in advance,

When retrieving files from SIMTEL20 to your MULTICS host you must
tell FTP the following:

quote "type L 8"

before starting the transfer.  All files are then stored in MULTICS
9-bit "bytes", whether they are binary or ascii on SIMTEL20.

After you have them on your host, you should have Kermit treat them as
ASCII files in order to get them over to your micro correctly.  You
should make sure that MULTICS Kermit defaults to ASCII and your
Kermit-PC does the same.  If not, give them the appropriate commands
before initiating the transfer.

I just bought a StarCard.  I love it, and WordStar really zips with it, but 
maybe I can make it do even better.  The CP/M disk that comes with the card
includes drivers for the screen, Apple RAM printer buffer, floppy, etc.  There
is also a file called RAMDISK.DVR.  This file isn't the code that allows Apple
DOS to use the StarCard's RAM as a RAMdisk, because that file is called
DOSRDISK (I think - I don't have the manual here at work). 

Other than including RAMDISK.DVR in the list of files on the disk, the 
StarCard manual makes no mention whatever of it.  Is RAMDISK.DVR a real CP/M
RAMdisk driver, and if so, will it work with the Apple //e extended 80-column
card, or does it require the RamFactor? 

Thanks for any light you can shed on this.

Cheers,

Can someone explain the practice of giving "LU" type library files the extension
.LLB instead of the default .LBR?  This seems to be happening with some
regularity in the more recent SIG/M volumes - the "-CATALOG" file will say
.LBR, but on SIMTEL20, the actual file will say .LLB!  This seems a bit strange.

Frank,

I believe the reason for the .LLB designation was to circumvent LU's
restriction on including .LBR files, which was designed to avoid
recursion.

  The RAMDISK.DVR program was written specifically for the add-on piggy-back
ram board for the starcard.  With this card you can have a 256K ram disk in
CP/M.  I beleive the source is available from PCPI in their toolkit package.
It is possible that this could be modified to use the other Ram cards but that
exercise is left to the student.

No, the RAMDISK.DVR file is not a driver to a ramdisk using the Apple's
RAM.  Notice the 50-pin connector on your Appli-Card?  This connector
allows you to interface with PCPI's RAM modules.  The RAM modules are
128K each and allows only two to be piggy-backed on to the Appli-Card.
With two modules, you have about 222K for a ramdisk.

     Will a Z-System run under MP/M?  I don't know enough about MP/M to
answer this question, and I had been hoping that in the past few days since
this question was posed to me someone who knows something about MP/M would
jump in and answer it.
 
     If MP/M uses individual command processors that run just under the
BDOS, then there is a chance that they can be replaced by a ZCPR3 command
processor.  If the MP/M command processor has extra functions related to the
multitasking, then the answer is likely to be no.  I am quite sure that
ZRDOS cannot be substituted for the MP/M BDOS, since the latter supports
functions not found in the standard BDOS.
 
     My completely uneducated answer is 'no,' but I hope someone will prove
me wrong!

     A number of people have inquired about the various autoinstall versions
of ZCPR3 and Z-System.  Here is a matrix of the four products available from
Echelon:
 
          version               basic package           complete package
        ----------              -------------           ----------------
 
        Z3-DOT-COM                 49.95                     99.00
 
        Z-COM                      69.95                    119.00
 
 
     What are the differences?  Let's start with the two package types,
since that is the easier question.  The basic packages have only the
autoinstall material.  With the complete packages you are paying Echelon an
extra fee to put nearly a hundred Z-System utility programs on diskette for
you.  If you have access to a Z-Node or SIMTEL20, you can get all those
utilities at no cost, but you may prefer to save the time and trouble and
Echelon do it for you.
 
     Now for the differences between the versions.  Z3-DOT-COM is an
autoinstall version of ZCPR3 only.  It does not include the ZRDOS
replacement for the disk operating system (BDOS).  Also, the implementation
of ZCPR3 in this version does not include the IOP (I/O Package).  All other
ZCPR3 facilities are implemented.
 
     Z-COM is an autoinstall version of the complete Z-System.  It included
ZRDOS, which gives you many nice features including: (1) automatic disk
login after changing floppies; (2) support for the archive file attribute so
that automatic backups are facilitated; and (3) support for I/O package
operations.  Z-COM includes an IOP interface so that Echelon's commercial
IOPs can be run.  These allow redirection of console or printer output to a
disk file, keyboard macros, and print spooling.
 
     Which should you buy?  With only a $20 difference between Z3-DOT-COM
and Z-COM, the latter is the better deal.  I can think of only two reasons
why some people would prefer Z3-DOT-COM.  First, the IOP support in Z-COM
takes an additional 1.5K away from the TPA (use program memory).  Second,
you may prefer to use, for example, P2DOS instead of ZRDOS.  On the other
hand, for only $20 extra, why not give ZRDOS a try.
 
     Many people think that if they use one of the autoinstall versions of
ZCPR3 they will lose the flexibility of tailoring the system to their own
preferences.  This is not true.  I have made extensive customizations to
both autoinstall versions, and I will be publishing an article on this
subject in The Computer Journal in the issue after the next one.  Anyone who
would be able to assemble up a custom manual version of ZCPR3 can equally
well modify Z-COM.  With a little ingenuity there are no limits.  I made
modified versions of Z3-DOT-COM and Z-COM so that I could freely switch
between them at any time.  That way I can run Z3-DOT-COM with its larger TPA
normally and switch to Z-COM only when I need IOP support.  I even have
aliases that will install Z-COM, load the IOP, turn on redirection, run a
program, and finally reinstall Z3-DOT-COM!!  I wish Echelon offered a
combination package with both autoinstall versions together at perhaps $15
more than Z-COM alone.  Let me add that the autoinstall versions offer one
advantage over a manually installed Z-System.  For people who occasionally
need a larger TPA than is possible under ZCPR3, with a simple command you
can return to your standard CP/M system.
 
     For reference, here again is the information on Echelon:
 
                        Echelon, Inc.
                        885 N. San Antonio Road
                        Los Altos, CA 94022
                        415-948-3820
 
Let me repeat my disclaimer.  Although my wife is a dealer for Echelon, we
have no financial interest in sales Echelon makes directly.  The comments
above are thus made without financial bias.  I love the Z-System, and the
autoinstall versions make it easy for (almost) anyone with a CP/M-2.2 system
to have it running in a few minutes.

     Tony Li asked about a version of ZCPR3 for a VT-180.  I have ZCPR3
running on a VT-180, but it is running in conjunction with Multisystem-180
(MS-180), a commercial product that allows the Robin to read, write, and
format many foreign disk formats (it makes yours drives look like any
combination that you want of drives from other machines).  Therefore, I am
not in a position to give you a copy of it unless you purchase MS-180.
 
     The difficulty in getting ZCPR3 to run on the VT-180 is the lack of the
BIOS source code.  With MS-180 one gets the source code to the enhanced
BIOS.  Then one can readily make the modifications required to get a custom
version of ZCPR3 running.  The cost of MS-180 is $80 in the version that
supports standard 48-tpi drives or $100 in the version that includes support
for 96-tpi drop-in-replacement drives.
 
     I repeat the recommendation I made in previous messages -- if you want
to do things the simplest way, buy one of the autoinstall versions from
Echelon.  They cost little more than the cost of ZRDOS alone (which is worth
having), and they run very nicely on the VT-180 (I have used them on the
Robin myself along with Multisystem).
 
                                    Jay Sage
 
Non-disclaimer:  My wife's company sells MS-180, and thus I do have a
financial interest in its sale.  Nevertheless, unless you have use for the
multiple formats capability, are troubled by some of the bugs in the
original DEC BIOS, or just can't resist the idea of having a BIOS with
source code, I recommend that you get one of the Echelon packages directly
from them.

I would like to call to the attention of the CP/M community what may be the
only computer magazine still in existence that has a primary focus on CP/M
computers.  It is called The Computer Journal (TCJ).  Although not many have
been aware of it before, it seems to have been around for quite a while.  It
comes out approximately every two months, and the latest issue is #25.  TCJ
has especially strong coverage in the area of ZCPR and Ampro computers.  It
will also be adopting the now orphaned Morrow machines.  To me it is what
Micro Cornucopia used to be before it virtually abandoned 8-bit systems.
 
Here are the feature topics in issue #25:
 
        Repairing and Modifying Printed Circuits
 
        Z-Notes: Z-COM Versus the 'Hacker' Version of Z-System
                (regular column on ZCPR3/Z-System)
 
        The C Column
 
        Adding a Serial Port to the AMPRO Little Board
 
        The SCSI Interface: Building a SCSI Adapter

        AMPRO 186 Column
 
        ZSIG
                (regular column by me on Z-Systems Interest Group)

I think you're right about the original LU program, but I am using
LU86 - a CPM-86 version of LU by a different author, and the documentation
says it will allow LBR files to be put into an LBR file, which gets
rid of the need for .LLB files.

In response to Richard Foulk's request for a source of a good S-100
bus definition, there is no place better than the experts.
The IEEE Mirco said the following back in 1983 (I don't subscribe so
I don't know if the information, such as price has changed.):

The 40-page document, IEEE Std 696-1983 is available from the IEEE
Computer Society Order Dept., PO Box 80452, Worldway Postal Center,
Los Angeles, CA 90080. The price is $6.75 for IEEE memebers and $7.50
for nonmembers, plus $2.00 shipping and handling (California
Residents add 6 percent sales tax).

These are the people to contact for the real standard definition.  It
is well written and very readable.

As for the project of connecting two 20 slot motherboards together,
the standard says that a maximum of 22 devices may be connected to
the bus and that the total signal path may not be more than 25 inches
long.  If you need that big a motherboard I'm sure you have done more
S-100 work than I, but I think you may run into awful ringing
problems with that size of motherboard.

I hope one of the Gurus listening in will give some more usefull
advice!

Version 1.05 incorporates the following features (over and above 1.04):

1.	Provides a built-in history mechanism similar to that in
	Berkeley-Unix's CSH ("sea-shell").  Included is a built-in
	command "h" that diplays the history.  See beginning of
	package's file "history.doc" for more details.


2.	Provides detached enhancement ability.  An additional routine can be
	executed just before the history routine.  If a file named
	"CCP.EXT" exists on the "temporary disk" (set by setdef), then for
	each command line processed by CCP, that routine is loaded to
	address 6000 (hex) and "called".

	The intended purpose of this "hook" is to allow a HLL or MLL
	routine to be written for easy enhancements.  The language in
	mind is "C", and an example test case has been provided in the
	distribution.


3.	Provides a fix to CP/M Plus's handling of lines that start with a colon.
	"With" the fix, the "return code" is NOT reset with every command line
	executed, but IS reset upon cold boot.

	The purpose of this is to allow this author's port of the
	"Aussie-Make" to properly terminate make-execution upon
	an step-wise error (I posted this "make" to net.micro.cpm).

	For this to work, one's compilers, linkers, assemblers, etc need
	to set the return-status upon error.  I have included in my
	distribution, several RSX examples -- the ones I use on several
	of my software tools -- that cause my software to set the
	return-status.  They should be easy to modify for "your" tools.


4. 	I reinstituted the conditional-assembly flag that when used,
	makes the user NOT be in the prompt when the user number
	is ZERO.  This author doesn't use non-0 user spaces,
	and likes a "non-busy" prompt.  Set the other way, the original
	code is reinstituted, so there shouldn't be a problem with other
	people's builds.  


5.	With these features, the CCP remains less than 4K (albeit, getting
	close).  All added enhancements are conditionally assembled.

6.	Quite a few auxillary files are included into the distribution
	for development use.  Some may be useable "asis", and some should
	be useable as templates that can be modified for other systems.

Fellow CP/Mers - Directory <CPM.TURBODOS> on SIMTEL20 contains a file called
LUFIX.TD, which describes why LU300.COM won't run correctly without modif-
ication under later versions of TurboDOS.  Patches are provided for LU300,
but not for LU310.  This message contains the patches for LU310.


     LUFIX.TD says in part:

"... LU (BDS C actually) uses unpublished information to see if a
console character has been typed. Using BDOS call 11, the accumulator
will return 00 if there is no console input or FF if there is a character
waiting. In CP/M, HL will contain 0000 if no character else 0001. BDS C
uses the (UNPUBLISHED!) value in HL to check console status rather than
A. TurboDOS (and it may or may not have a bug there, but I wouldn't argue
because HL is not defined as return value) returns HL=undefined if there
is no character, or 00FF if there is.

The following patch will fix LU to work properly under TurboDOS. Please
note that this patch utilizes string storage used to contain the
error message, "EXECL: Command line overflow" and will shorten that
message to just "EXECL". ..."


     Since there is enough space available for it, I have used the same
technique as described above, but have provided a more meaningful error
message, "Cmd line ovrflow".

		    Fixes for LU.COM version 3.10:

1. At address 47FA, change CD 05 00 (CALL 0005) to CD A0 4E (CALL 4EA0).

2. At address 4E8D, modify the original code to the following:

4E8D   43 6D 64 20  6C 69 6E 65  20 6F 76 72  66 6C 6F 77  Cmd line ovrflow
4E9D   0D 0A 24 FE  0B C2 05 00  CD 05 00 26  00 6F C9     ..$~.B..M..&.oI

     The above hex dump contains the following patch:

			   4EA0  CP   A,0B
			   4EA2  JP   NZ,0005    
			   4EA5  CALL 0005

2.	Provides detached enhancement ability.  An additional routine can be
	executed just before the history routine.  If a file named
	"CCP.EXT" exists on the "temporary disk" (set by setdef), then for
	each command line processed by CCP, that routine is loaded to
	address 6000 (hex) and "called".

	The intended purpose of this "hook" is to allow a HLL or MLL
	routine to be written for easy enhancements.  The language in
	mind is "C", and an example test case has been provided in the
	distribution.


3.	Provides a fix to CP/M Plus's handling of lines that start with a colon.
	"With" the fix, the "return code" is NOT reset with every command line
	executed, but IS reset upon cold boot.

	The purpose of this is to allow this author's port of the
	"Aussie-Make" to properly terminate make-execution upon
	an step-wise error (I posted this "make" to net.micro.cpm).

	For this to work, one's compilers, linkers, assemblers, etc need
	to set the return-status upon error.  I have included in my
	distribution, several RSX examples -- the ones I use on several
	of my software tools -- that cause my software to set the
	return-status.  They should be easy to modify for "your" tools.


4. 	I reinstituted the conditional-assembly flag that when used,
	makes the user NOT be in the prompt when the user number
	is ZERO.  This author doesn't use non-0 user spaces,
	and likes a "non-busy" prompt.  Set the other way, the original
	code is reinstituted, so there shouldn't be a problem with other
	people's builds.  


5.	With these features, the CCP remains less than 4K (albeit, getting
	close).  All added enhancements are conditionally assembled.

6.	Quite a few auxillary files are included into the distribution
	for development use.  Some may be useable "asis", and some should
	be useable as templates that can be modified for other systems.

Subj: turbodos/lu function 11 bug

I believe this is correctly classified as a Turbodos bug.

For functions with a defined return value for A
the CP/M 2.2 BDOS returns the A register value in L, and H = 0.
This is documented, but some CP/M emulators don't copy the
return value into L; it seems TurboDOS is one of those.

CP/M 2.2, function 11 returns A=L= 01 if a character is waiting, A=L=0 if not.

But there is actually a bug in the 2.2 BDOS related to console
status.  The BDOS maintains a 1-character type-ahead buffer (to check
for ^S and ^C) that the BDOS fills when a character is typed during
BDOS character output functions.  The BDOS status functions (6 and
11) don't check to see if this buffer has been filled when reporting
status.  Result: if you type a character while the BDOS is printing a
string and the program later checks to see if a key has been pressed,
it won't see it on a bdos status call.

   I was wondering if anyone out there can help me.  I am using
CP/M on my enhanced Apple //e.  I now have the need for using
files greater than the size of an Apple 5.25" disk.  It must be
one continuous file so I can't break it into multiple disks.  I
am now considering purchasing either a RAMcard (probably AE
Ramfactor so it would be compatible with a //gs if/when I
upgrade/purchase one.)  or a 3.5" 800K drive (probably from
Central Point).  I would like to know if anyone has used either
of these with Apple CP/M.  I am using Microsoft CP/M ver 2.23.
It's dated 1982, so I doubt it will recognize Apples new
disk drive protocols.  I need to know what, if anything, I
would need to do to get CP/M do recognize these.  Do I need
to get a newer version of CP/M or will either of these come
with the software.  My setup is as follows:

      Slot          Peripheral
        1            Grappler parallel printer card
        2            Apple SSC
        6            Apple disk drive controller
        7            ALS Z-card

   This only leaves either slot 4 or 5 for the new device.
Any help would be appreciated.

I have a pair of old Disctron hard disks, a DP400 (40mb fixed) and a
DP100 (10mb removable) that I want to hook up to my CP/M machine (an
H89 with a SCSI port added to it).  These drives are real antiques:
8" platters, 28 hard sectors of 256 bytes each (if memory serves).
Currently, they're controlled by an equally off-the-wall DTC controller
board (built especially for these drives).  I've talked to the supplier
of my SCSI port, and he says that the software he's developed for it
will only work properly with an Adaptec or Xebec or equivalent SCSI
drive controller.  My question:  will the Adaptec or the Xebec control
these mostrosities?  Or am I faced with the task of developing my own
code for the oddball DTC controller?  Thanks in advance for any advice
and info!

I am a new user of ZCPR3 (Z3.COM) and would like to be able to recall
previous command lines for editing. Could anyone give me any ideas on how to
do this? Is there a Z-system utility which will do it ?

Many thanks,
