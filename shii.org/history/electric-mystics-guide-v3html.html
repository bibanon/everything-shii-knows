                        * Introduction *
 
The Electric Mystic's Guide is a non-technical survey of
all major documents, archives and services of relevance
to religious studies and related fields that are
available through the international, academic computer
networks commonly referred to as the Net (BITNET,
Internet and affiliated networks).  This includes
networked papers, reviews, book notes, dissertations,
major sacred texts, software programs, electronic mail
address collections, general information files, data
banks, electronic journals, newsletters, online
discussion groups, specialized commercial and public
networks, and relevant networked organizations,
associations, institutions and companies.  It should be
noted that the Electric Mystic's Guide is not meant to be
a handbook on how to use the Net, and thus assumes a
certain level of familiarity with FTP, Telnet, Listserv
and other Net operating programs.  Users hits and tips
have been included throughout the Guide.
 
It is interesting to note that the majority of the
approximately 200 files documented (in Volume One) have
been placed on the Net in the last twenty four months.
This would suggest that the end of this decade will see
well over two thousand networked documents relevant to
religious studies.  The number of religious studies and
related scholars presently online is unknown but
certainly exceeds ten thousand.  No comprehensive
electronic mail address book for religious studies exists
at this point in time.  We can look forward to a
proliferation of specialized archives over the next few
years.  At present, I am aware of Aboriginal, Buddhism,
Early Christianity and Judaism, Jewish, and Social
Sciences networked archives (see Table of Contents,
Volume Two).
 
Electronic mail addresses given within this Guide are in
BITNET and Internet format, unless otherwise stated.
Login to FTP nodes listed herein as anonymous with your
e-mail address as the password unless otherwise stated.
All other aspects of this Guide are system neutral.
Travellers on the Net should note that there are many
versions of Telnet and FTP software and a variety of
login procedures.  Most systems will offer some form of
help if you enter the command HELP or ?.
 
The Electric Mystic's Guide was previously written as one
complete document but has been divided into three
volumes, due to its growing size and technical
restrictions within some systems on the size of network
accessible manuscripts.  The Guide has the following
format: Volume One documents a wide variety of over 200
networked files of direct and indirect relevance to
religious studies and related fields. The selection of
material was based on the scholarly nature of the
documents or their significance as general information
files.  No attempt has been made to document every file
related to religion on the Net, due to the transient
nature, and questionable academic value of some of the
material that has be placed on network fileservers.  If
a document has been overlooked that the reader feels
should be listed in the Electric Mystic's Guide, please
contact the author with details of its content and
location.  Volume One also has extensive information on
how to retrieve documents listed in this Guide, how to
use Listserv and FTP, and how to search Listserv
logbooks.
 
Volume Two provides detailed information on networked
document archives of interest to the religious studies
field.  Volume Three provides information on relevant
networked organizations, online academic conferences,
journals and newsletters, and commercial religious
studies related networks and various other animals to be
found within the emerging Electric Gaia.  Each volume
will also  feature a glossary of terms and a glossary of
commands.  [Not yet written].
 
Each volume has an index of document titles.  Volume One
also includes an index of authors and an index of
author's electronic mail addresses.  The low ascii
versions of the Electric Mystic's Guide do not contain
these indexes.
 
NOTE:  Volume Two has not yet been made available on the
Net.
 
                    A Note to New Networkers
 
It is impossible for this guide to tell you everything
that you will need to know about using the Net.  It is
therefore strongly recommended that the new networker
begin by identifying local support personnel and make
friends with them (take them out to dinner, buy them a
large gift), take a course or two in the use of
electronic mail and related stuff and subscribe, as soon
as you know how, to the online forum, HELP-NET.  Send the
e-mail message SUBSCRIBE HELP-NET your name to
LISTSERV@TEMPLEVM.  HELP-NET is intended for the new user
and is the best online forum for asking questions about
how to use the Net and find information within it.  An
index is available that lists very helpful information
files available from the HELP-NET fileserver.  Send the
command INDEX HELP-NET to LISTSERV@TEMPLEVM for the index
of files.
 
The Electric Mystic's Guide assumes that the reader has
a basic grasp of electronic mail (e-mail) and is able to
send mail on his or her own local system.  It also assume
that the reader has already installed a modem and knows
how to use their own person computer and communication
software.  The numerous types of mainframe systems and
communication software make it impossible for the Guide
to give details on how to download (or upload) a file or
program from a mainframe to a personal computer.  The
author is presently writing a general guide to the
Internet for Van Nostrand Reinhold Press (forthcoming,
1993).  The Electric Mystic's Guide will eventually be
thoroughly cross-referenced to the VNR Guide to the
Internet so that new users may quickly find more
information on how to use the Net.
 
     WARNING:  I cannot possibly answer every query
     from readers concerning how to use e-mail,
     upload files, install a modem, unzip a file or
     overcome unrequited love.  The main intention
     behind this Guide is not to instruct the
     reader on how to overcome every unforeseeable
     problem but to equip the reader with basic
     resources, direct to appropriate online
     forums, and engender skills that will help the
     new networker become proficient at mining the
     Net.  I will gladly answer queries concerning
     errors and problems within the Electric
     Mystic's Guide.  Inappropriate queries will
     receive a pre-written reply that directs the
     reader to more appropriate online sources of
     instruction and information.
 
 
               * 1.  Online Academic Conferences *
 
One of the best features of the Net are online discussion
groups.  These discussion groups allow people from all
around the globe to communicate within a topically
focused forum.  Online discussion groups or academic
conferences are referred to as conferencing systems,
special interest groups (SIGs), newsgroups (USENET based
groups), Listserv lists (BITNET based groups), Interest
Groups (Internet based groups), and bulletin boards
(bulletin board is the term usually used for discussion
groups on commercial networks).  Online discussion groups
are managed by an individual or group of people variously
referred to as one of the following: coordinator, editor,
facilitator, moderator, monitor, owner, or sysop.  The
following section describes Listserv lists and Usenet
newsgroups that are relevant to religious studies and
related areas.
 
Online discussion groups function by redistributing any
mail sent to the group to each member or subscriber.  In
the jargon of the Net, writing to a group is referred to
as posting.  If it is a question that is asked, this is
then referred to as a query.  Within BITNET, this process
is referred to as posting a query to a list.  If a member
posts a message, it is almost instantly redistributed to
every other member.  This process permits everyone to
"hear" what everyone else is "saying" within the group.
The group moderator(s) ensures that discussions remain
focused within the group's topic and also ensures that e-
mail etiquette is maintained by all participants.  Some
moderators compile numerous postings together into
digests, which are posted to the membership on a daily
basis.  Digests prevent a flood of individual postings
from cluttering subscriber's mail boxes.
 
There are over two thousand different discussion groups
covering topics of academic and social interest.  The
number of subscribers on online discussion groups range
from a few dozen to thousands of members, with the
largest discussion groups numbering in the tens of
thousands of subscribers.  Whether you are interested in
homebrewing or ethnomusicology, chances are that you will
find a topic of interest.  These groups are like
conferences that never end, interactive magazines,
academic lounges that are always full (and never close),
and function as research tools, social forums and virtual
encyclopedias.
 
* IOUDAIOS -- A Success Story
 
One of the best examples of a productive and valuable
academic online discussion group is the Listserv list,
IOUDAIOS, also titled, The International Forum for First
Century Judaism and Christian Origins.  IOUDAIOS is
devoted to the exploration of first-century Judaism with
special interest in the writings of Philo of Alexandria
and Flavius Josephus.  This discussion group began as an
informal seminar for the discussion of two papers by
Robert A. Kraft but quickly blossomed into an
international forum, with over 400 participants in North
America, Europe, Australia, and The Middle East.
IOUDAIOS now has an extensive Listserv fileserver archive
of prepublication papers, subject glossaries and large
bibliographies.  IOUDAIOS also recently began
disseminating electronic reviews of new books.  A number
of the prepublication papers were successfully published
in various scholarly journals after benefiting from
constructive comments from IOUDAIOS members.
 
The first moderator of IOUDAIOS was Steve Mason (York
University).  Professor Mason promoted the new online
discussion group by writing to scholars around the globe
and invited them to explore the world of online
scholarship and join the group.  Professor Mason then
strove to ensure that the discussion remained focused,
casual yet polite and professional.  As a result of this
unusual effort, IOUDAIOS membership is graced with many
prominent scholars in the field of first-century Judaism
and early Christianity.  IOUDAIOS is now moderated by
David Reimer (Wilfrid Laurier University).
 
The success of IOUDAIOS demonstrates how an academic
online discussion group can foster research, facilitate
the prepublication process and the dissemination of
research and pedagogical material, and enable scholars
around the globe to efficiently communicate with one
another.
 
 
        How to Make the Most of Online Discussion Groups
 
 
* Do Not Over Subscribe
 
Avoid the temptation to subscribe to numerous discussion
groups at first.  This will lead to your mailbox being
flooded with mail.  Some discussion groups send out more
than twenty postings per day. Over subscribing can lead
to receiving hundreds of messages a day.  On some systems
this will result in a full mailbox and troublesome
technical problems.  Start with one or two lists and
ensure that the volume is not too heavy before moving on
to explore others.
 
* Write Clearly and Concisely
 
Composing an e-mail posting is much like talking publicly
in the faculty lounge.  You should avoid being a windbag,
using English poorly and saying anything libelous about
colleagues.  For computer mediated communication to be
effective it is important to observe a few similar
guidelines for composing an e-mail message to a
discussion group.  When writing, keep in mind that
reading a long text on a computer screen is not entirely
pleasant.  Therefore, keep your postings to under one
hundred lines.  If you need more length, break the
message up into sections and give each section a subject
heading: Part One, Part Two and so on.  NOTE THAT WRITING
IN CAPITAL LETTERS IS LIKE SHOUTING AND IS ALWAYS
ANNOYING.  If you have a question to ask, it is always
best to limit each posting to one question at a time, so
as to not overwhelm your readers.  Take the time to write
properly and spell correctly, as poor grammar and
spelling will simply encourage the reader to ignore you
and use the DELETE key.  The tone of your letter should
be as polite as possible, because electronic text does
not convey all the subtle body language clues that soften
humour, sarcasm and wit.  Always remember that your
posting is public, will likely be recorded on a
university mainframe somewhere, and if poorly written or
libelous may end up on a faculty lounge wall or lawyer's
briefcase.
 
* Use the NOMAIL (Listserv) Command
 
When you are going to be away from your computer terminal
for more than a few days, use the NOMAIL command to tell
Listserv to stop sending you mail from Listserv lists
while you are gone.  To do this, send the following
command interactively or as an e-mail message to the
Listserv address of the discusson group (Listserv@node
where node is the address of the list):
 
     SET listname NOMAIL    (where listname is the name
of the list)
 
Do not send this and other commands to the list's mailing
address (the address you use to post messages), as this
will lead to the command being posted to all of the
list's subscribers.  This is embarrassing for you and
annoying to others.
 
It is best to write down the list name and address of
each Listserv list that is set to NOMAIL so that you will
remember to set these lists back to MAIL upon return with
the command:
 
     SET listname MAIL
 
Using the NOMAIL command will save you the annoyance of
a full mailbox upon return and will prevent error
messages from being returned to the list moderator.  List
moderators frequently unsubscribe members whose mailboxes
are returning error messages.
 
In the event that you forget if you have set a list to
either MAIL or NOMAIL, you can send the following command
to the Listserv address of the list:
 
     QUERY listname
 
This command, when sent to Listserv, will return a
message that tells you how your distribution options are
presently set for any given Listserv list.
 
If you fear missing some interesting postings as a result
of using the NOMAIL command it is possible to retrieve
the list's logbooks from the period you were away.
Listserv logbooks record all postings to the list in
monthly logs.  To retrieve an index of a list's logbook,
send the following command interactively or as an e-mail
message to the Listserv address of the discusson group
(Listserv@node where node is the address of the list):
 
     INDEX listname    (where listname is the name of the
list)
 
For more information on retrieving Listserv logbooks, see
the section Retrieving Logbooks below, page 11.
 
* Use the DELETE Key
 
Many new networkers succumb to the temptation to read
every posting sent to a discussion group.  This is no
more necessary or productive than reading every item in
a newspaper or journal.  By paying attention to the
subject headings and through a liberal use of the DELETE
key (or your systems equivalent command), it is possible
to wade through a large number of postings quickly and
efficiently.  Always give a subject heading to any e-mail
message as a courtesy to others.
 
* Take Care When Replying
 
Occasionally, you will read a message from an online
discussion group and want to reply to the individual who
wrote the posting but not to the whole group.  Some
systems have a REPLY command that will allow you to
compose a reply without retyping the entire e-mail
address.  This REPLY command will send your reply back to
the entire list, not just to the person who wrote the
original posting.  REPLY (or your system's equivalent
command) must be used with care to avoid sending a
personal and private note to an entire list.  This
mistake occurs quite often on the Net and has been the
source of acute embarrassment.  Therefore, when you use
the REPLY key, always check the mail header to see where
your reply is being sent.  Some VM/CMS systems have a
REPLY FROM command that will return your note only to the
person who wrote the original posting to a list.  Both
REPLY and REPLY FROM should be used with extreme caution
if your message is personal and private.
 
* Subscribe to NEW-LIST
 
NEW-LIST is an information service that posts messages
concerning newly created lists.  List changes and
deletions are also announced here.  This is also a forum
for asking if a list on a certain topic presently exists.
To subscribe, send the command to Listserv@ndsuvm1
 
     SUB NEW-LIST Yourfirstname Yourlastname
 
Subscription to NEW-LIST list is highly recommended for
all networkers.
 
* Start A New Discussion Group
 
If you find that there is no existing group for the topic
you wish to discuss, talk to your system administration
or postmaster.  It is usually not difficult to obtain
permission to start a new online discussion group if
there is sufficient justification.  Before doing so,
ensure that a group similar to the one you wish to start
does not already exist.  You should also talk to someone
who moderates an online discussion group, to find out how
much work is involved, and also retrieve and read the
article How to Start a BITNET LISTSERV Discussion Group:
A Beginner's Guide, by Diane Kovacs et al.  Available
from PACS-L, Listserv@uhupvm1 or Listserv@uhupvm1.uh.edu
as KOVACS PRV2N1.
 
 
                  Directories of Listserv Lists
 
The following is information regarding a variety of
Listserv list directories presently available on the Net.
These directories will help you find online discussion
groups for personal interest or as research forums.
 
* BITNET Listserv Global List of Public Listserv Lists
 
This directory contains brief information on all of the
discussion groups on BITNET.  Check first whether a copy
of the list is kept locally.  To retrieve this document,
send the command to any Listserv:
 
     LIST GLOBAL
 
On Internet, send the above command as a mail message to
Listserv@vm1.nodak.edu.  A 3000 line file named Listserv
Lists will be returned.
 
The directory Listserv Lists is constantly updated and
can be searched remotely to find more Listserv lists.
Send the following command to Listserv:
 
     LIST GLOBAL /keyword
 
where keyword is the discussion group topic that
interests you.  Some relevant keywords for religion
related lists are muslim, islam, buddha, buddhist,
native, christ, ministry, jew, orthodox, pagan, hebrew,
mason, evangel, occult, religion and catholic.
 
* SRI NIC Maintained Interest-Groups List of Lists
 
The SRI network service maintains an extensive directory
of list descriptions, variously known as Interest Groups
List of Lists, Interests-Groups, SIGLIST and Interests
Lists.  To retrieve this directory, send the following
command to mail-server@nisc.sri.com
 
     SEND NETINFO/INTEREST-GROUPS
 
The above command will return twenty-six files, each
approximately 800 lines long.  Further information on the
NIC server itself is available with the command SEND
HELP.  This document is also available via FTP as
interest-groups.Z from the node ftp.nisc.sri.com in the
directory /netinfo/.   This file is over 900K in size, so
ensure that you have sufficient disk space to receive the
document.
 
* Dartmouth Merged List of Internet and BITNET Lists
 
Dartmouth University maintains a combined list of over
2,500 BITNET based Listserv lists and Internet based
interest groups.  To retrieve this directory, send the
following commands to Listserv@dartcms1 or
Listserv@dartcms1.dartmouth.edu
 
     INDEX SIGLISTS
     SEND LISTTEXT PACKAGE
 
This document is also available via FTP as a variety of
files from the node dartcms1.dartmouth.edu
(129.170.16.19) in the directory /siglists/.  There is
also a Macintosh hypercard application as well as VM/CMS,
VAX/VMS and UNIX applications that format, display and
search the Dartmouth List of Lists.  Retrieve the READ.ME
file from the above FTP directory for more information.
 
* Dartmouth INTGROUP Database Server
 
Dartmouth University also maintains a searchable database
that consists of the SIR Interest Groups list, the BITNET
Listserv Global List, and the archives of the NEW-LIST
Listserv list.  Send the command INFO DATABASE to
Listserv for complete information on how to search this
database.

          How to Subscribe to Online Discussion Groups
 
There are three basic types of discussion groups;
Listserv lists, Internet interest groups, and USENET
newsgroups (USENET newsgroups are documented at the end
of this section).  To simplify the subscription process,
each discussion group listed below has instructions
indicating where a subscription request is to be sent.
The following information is included with each
documented discussion group:
 
Subscription Method:
(Automatic to Server or By Moderator)
Internet Subscription Address:
(Use if you are on Internet)
BITNET Subscription Address:
(Use if you are on BITNET)
Mailing Address:
(Use this address to post  to the discussion group)
Number of Subscribers:
(Total number of members)
Logbooks:
(Records of past group conversations)
Other Archived Material:
(Other files, such as papers and bibliographies)
Gatewayed to USENET:
(Some BITNET/Internet discussion groups are also
available as USENET newsgroups)
*Posting Volume:
(Average number of postings per day)
 
*Not listed in this edition.
 
If the Subscription Method is listed as By Moderator,
then to subscribe, send an e-mail message to the
Subscription Request Address that includes your name,
address and institutional affiliation with your request
to subscribe.  By Moderator indicates that the
subscription request will be received and processed by
the moderator of the discussion group.
 
If the Subscription Method is Automatic to Server, then
send the following e-mail message to the Subscription
Request Address.
 
     SUBSCRIBE listname Yourfirstname Yourlastname
 
The listname will be indicated in the Subscription Method
line.  If you are on Internet, use the Internet address,
if you are on BITNET, use the BITNET address.  If a
BITNET address is not available, BITNET users can use the
Internet address.
 
Automatic to Server indicates that the subscription
request will be received and processed automatically.
The above command must be sent to the Subscription
Request Address as indicated.  Remember to leave the
subject line blank and to turn off any automatic
signature file.  This is necessary as your subscription
request will be processed automatically by a computer,
not by a person.
 
The following is an example of how each discussion group
is documented below:
 
* The International Forum for First Century Judaism and
Christian Origins (IOUDAIOS)
 
     Subscription Method:                    Automatic to
Server: SUB IOUDAIOS
     Internet Subscription Address:
Listserv@vm1.yorku.ca
     BITNET Subscription Address:       Listserv@yorkvm1
     Mailing Address:                   Ioudaios@yorkvm1
or Ioudaios@vm1.yorku.ca
     Number of Subscribers:             400
     Logbooks:                     Yes
     Other Archived Material:           Yes
 
To subscribe to this discussion group, send the following
e-mail message to Listserv@yorkvm1 or
Listserv@vm1.yorku.ca
 
     SUB IOUDAIOS your name   (Replace your name with
your first and last name)
 
If you are on BITNET, this command can be sent
interactively as follows:
 
     TELL LISTSERV AT YORKVM1 SUB IOUDAIOS
 
To unsubscribe from a discussion group, use either the
command UNSUB or SIGNOFF.  Due to various technical
problems that sometimes occur, it is recommended that you
maintain a file that records the address of the
discussion groups to which you subscribe, as well as the
address you subscribed under (BITNET or Internet).  To
unsubscribe from IOUDAIOS, send the following e-mail
message to Listserv@yorkvm1 or Listserv@vm1.yorku.ca
 
     SIGNOFF IOUDAIOS
 
If you are on BITNET, this command can be sent
interactively as follows:
 
     TELL LISTSERV AT YORKVM1 SIGNOFF IOUDAIOS
 
Note that if subscription was done by a moderator, the
moderator will have to unsubscribe you.  A frequent
mistake is to send these commands directly to the entire
discussion group.
 
NOTE:  Before subscribing to a Listserv list, each new
user must send the following command to Listserv:
 
     REGISTER your name
 
Replace your name with your own first and last name.
This command tells Listserv how to address you.
 
Directions for online discussion groups that have a
different method of subscribing then the above procedures
will have instructions included with individual entries.
 
 
                       Retrieving Logbooks
 
Many online discussion groups keep records of past
conversations in logbooks.  To retrieve a list of
logbooks and other files, send the command:
 
     INDEX Listname   (Where Listname is the Listserv
name of the discussion group)
 
This command must be sent to the server address.  For
example, to get the index of files available from
IOUDAIOS, send the command:
 
     INDEX IOUDAIOS
 
to Listserv@yorkvm1 or Listserv@vm1.yorku.ca.  Do not
send the INDEX IOUDAIOS command to the address
Ioudaios@yorkvm1 as this would result in the command
being posted to all 400 subscribers.
 
This INDEX command will retrieve a file that lists all
available logbooks and documents.  Listserv indexes look
like this following section from the CONTENTS filelist:
 
 NOTEBOOK archives for the list CONTENTS
 (Monthly notebook)
 
 filename filetype  GET  PUT  fm   lrecl     nrecs
Remarks
 -------- --------       ---  ---  ---  -----

Fri, 17 Jan 1992
 CONTENTS LOG9202   PRV  OWN  V    79   2875 Started on
Tue, 4 Feb 1992
 
The file name CONTENTS LOG9201 tells us that this file is
the log of all postings to CONTENTS in January 1992.  The
code PRV (PRIVATE) under the column GET means that only
members of this list may retrieve archived files and
logbooks.  If this code was ALL then both members and
non-members could retrieve logbooks and files.  In the
column under nrecs the number 128 means that this logbook
is 128 lines long.  To retrieve this logbook, send the
following command to either Listserv@yorkvm1 or
Listserv@vm1.yorku.ca:
 
     GET CONTENTS LOG9201
 
For information on searching Listserv logbooks, send the
command GET LISTDB MEMO to any Listserv address (for
example, to Listserv@uottawa or
Listserv@acadvm1.uottawa.ca).  Charles W. Bailey Jr., has
written a simplified explanation of how to search
Listserv logbooks.  This document may be retrieved as the
file pacsl_dbms.txt via FTP from the node hydra.uwo.ca in
the directory /libsoft/.
 
 
       BITNET and Internet Religious Studies Related Lists
 
The following information is based on Diane Kovacs'
Directory of Scholarly Electronic Conferences and NEW-

     BUDDHA-L is an electronic discussion group
     formed towards the end of providing a means
     for those interested in Buddhist Studies to
     exchange information and views.  It is hoped
     that the group will function as an open forum
     for scholarly discussion of topics relating to
     the history, literature and languages, fine
     arts, philosophy, and institutions of all
     forms of Buddhism.  It may also serve as a
     forum for discussion of issues connected to
     the teaching of Buddhist studies at the
     university level, and as a place for posting
     notices of employment opportunities.
 
     The primary purpose of this list is to provide
     a forum for serious academic discussion.  It
     is open to all persons inside and outside the
     academic context who wish to engage in
     substantial discussion of topics relating to
     Buddhism and Buddhist studies.  BUDDHA-L is
     not to be used for proselytizing for or
     against Buddhism in general, any particular
     form of Buddhism, or any other religion or
     philosophy, nor is it to be used as a forum
     for making unsubstantiable confessions of
     personal conviction.

     GRASS (Generic Religions And Secret Societies)
     is a working group formed in order to write up
     brief descriptions of various religions and
     initiatory societies for whatever purposes you
     like, with the emphasis on use in roleplaying
     games. As is only natural given the subject
     matter, we have an initiatory requirement.
     Before being admitted to the group you must
     submit something of value to it. We suggest
     using a standard format (which may be found on
     grass-server@wharton.upenn.edu in the file
     grass.format), and placing your writeup in the
     public domain. Get a copy of GRASS.FORMAT and
     write up an organization with which you are
     familiar, or submit a substantial amount of
     constructive commentary on a writeup that
     already exists.

     IOUDAIOS (Greek for "Jew") is an electronic
     seminar devoted to the exploration of
     first-century Judaism its special interest is
     in the writings of Philo of Alexandria and
     Flavius Josephus. The conference began as an
     informal discussion of two papers by Robert A.
     Kraft (Pennsylvania) but quickly blossomed
     into an international forum, with participants
     in North America, Europe, Australia, and The
     Middle East.
 
     The Philonic and Josephan corpora are
     extensive enough that they invite all sorts of
     analysis -- from literary, historical, and
     philosophical perspectives, to name a few.
     There is also considerable interest, among
     participants, in the social realities that lie
     behind these texts and their broad historical
     context. Prospective members are warmly
     welcomed. (The discussion assumes a
     significant background in first-century
     Judaism and also the ability to read Greek).

     This list is originated from the State
     University of New York at Buffalo and is
     intended for discussion related to
     InterVarsity Christian Fellowship (IVCF). A
     multi-denominational Christian group on
     campuses across the United States, IVCF is
     affiliated with IFES (International Fellowship
     of Evangelical Students) worldwide. IVCF is a
     student led group on campuses, with guidance
     from (usually one) staff worker per chapter.
 
     Students traditionally have one Large Group
     meeting per week, which includes worship and
     fellowship with other Christians.  We also
     greatly encourage Small Group faith
     communities/bible studies.  The IVCF "credo"
     in western New York State is to (1) Build
     Collegiate Fellowships, (2) Develop Disciples
     who embody Biblical values, and (3) Engage the
     Campus in all it's ethnic diversity with the
     Gospel of Jesus Christ.
 
     Welcome in this list is discussion from
     members, staff, and all people affiliated with
     IVCF, or those wanting more information.
     However, this IVCF-L list does not represent
     Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, nor does it
     represent the values and/or beliefs of the
     members, staff, or other persons affiliated
     with the organization.  This list is strictly
     a discussion list with the IVCF logo. It was
     initiated by a student leader in InterVarsity,
     and many IVCF members are subscribed. This
     list, while not a "moderated" list, will be
     edited if inappropriate material is sent to
     it.

     This discussion group is a forum where Jews
     from all Jewish movements can discuss issues
     without fear of attacks about the legitimacy
     of their movements.  The only filtering of
     submissions that is done is (a) removal of
     attacks, (b) removal of material from
     non-Jewish movements (this determination is
     based on a definition seen on the USENET
     newsgroup, soc.culture.jewish, namely that a
     Jewish movement is one that uses only
     indisputably Jewish sources (i.e., Torah,
     Talmud) as the basis for its philosophy --
     thus the liberal movements, including
     Humanistic Judaism, are acceptable, whereas
     quasi-Christian movements, such as Jews for
     Jesus or "Messianic" (sic) Judaism is not).
     Submissions not meeting these guidelines will
     range from discussions between the moderator
     and the author to reword the inflammatory or
     offensive material, to outright rejection of
     the article.  The initial goal of the list was
     to provide a forum for discussions concerning
     issues of relevance to the more liberal
     movements (Reform, Reconstructionist,
     Conservative). Remember, it is acceptable to
     criticize the position taken by a given
     movement, as long as you word your submission
     in such as way as to not question the validity
     of that movement as a part of Judaism.

     liturgy.  The list does not confine itself to
     any one historical period, geographical area
     or Christian tradition.  Therefore
     contributions are welcome from all historical
     and theological fields.  We also welcome
     discussion from those involved in other
     disciplines such as literary analysis,
     comparative religions and sociology of
     religion.

     not pass on any message which contains or
     purports to contain material I am obliged to

     orders are obliged to conceal.  Within that
     restriction, I am as liberal as possible.
     Postings from non-Masons are welcome. So is
     criticism, as long as it is reasoned and in
     good taste.  Many current members of the list
     are Master Masons.  Others are simply
     interested or curious.

     Religion is a Listserv list for the scholarly
     discussion of Religions.  It is sponsored by
     the Harvard Center for the Study of World
     Religions.  Unlike lists with similar names,
     Religion does not deal with matters of
     personal faith or theology.  Rather, it's aim
     is to encourage discussion of the historical
     and comparative study and teaching of
     religions.  Relevant approaches include
     history, sociology, psychology, philosophy,
     literary criticism, and anthropology.
     Relevant issues include methodology in the
     study and teaching of religions; comparative
     themes such as myth, ritual, mysticism,
     community, and inter-religious contact; and
     issues specific to particular traditions.

                  USENET -- General Information
 
USENET is actually a worldwide network of over 10,000
hosts and 300,000 users.  Unlike BITNET and Internet,
USENET is not an academic network.  Most of USENET's
sites are commercial, but advertising is strictly
forbidden on USENET.  USENET supports one service only,
called news or newsgroups, and is available at most
Internet sites.  Unfortunately, USENET newsgroups are
largely unavailable to BITNET sites.  There is over 300
different newsgroups available, but not all sites carry
all newsgroups.  The following section provides
information on all religious studies related newsgroups.
As there are a number of different software platforms for
reading USENET newsgroups, this guide cannot give
specific details on accessing and reading USENET
newsgroups.  Users should take local courses and obtain
manuals on their sites' USENET news reader.
 
 
 
     Note: If you have access to both USENET and
     Internet e-mail, USENET is generally
     preferable as a method of access, as it
     requires fewer network resources per
     additional subscriber.  For those who do not
     have access to USENET, Internet and BITNET
     subscription information is given for
     newsgroups that are duplicated (gatewayed) as
     lists or interest groups.
 
 
The following helpful information files can be found in
the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  All of the
following are recommended reading for all USENET users.

periodic basis.  These articles tend to be general
information files useful to novice and experienced users.
 The List of Periodic Informational Postings, Part I and
II documents the majority of these periodic postings.
This list is a good directory to information files that
exist on USENET newsgroups.
 
* Accessing USENET Documents
 
The above USENET documents can be found in the newsgroup

           USENET Religious Studies Related Newsgroups
 
The following is a listing of all newsgroups of interest
to religious studies fields.  These groups are divided
into moderated and umoderated groups.  In moderated
newsgroups each posting is screened by a moderator before
being forwarded to the entire newsgroup.
 
* Moderated Newsgroups
 
To post to a moderated newsgroup, send your article to
the Submission Address.  The newsgroup moderator will
then forward your posting to the group.  Inappropriate
submissions will be returned with an explanation.  In
some cases submissions may be sent directly to the

the moderator.
 
* Discussion of the Baha'i Faith -- SOC.RELIGION.BAHAI
 
Submission Address: Direct to soc.religion.bahai or to
bahai-faith@oneworld.wa.com
 
The newsgroup will act as a non-threatening forum for
discussing and sharing information about the tenets,
history, and texts of the Baha'i Faith.  Prior to its
formation there was a good amount of traffic on this
topic in other newsgroups; this group provides a "single
point of contact" for such discussion.  Examples of posts
that fall within the group's scope are: The Baha'i
Faith's relation to other religions;  relevance of Baha'i
principles to current world events/problems; analysis of
particular scriptural passages or themes; and general
questions and answers.
 
The soc.religion.bahai newsgroup is gatewayed to USENET
from the moderated Internet mailing list, bahai-faith,
which shares soc.religion.bahai's policies.  Those
without USENET access should address subscription and
unsubscription requests to
bahai-faith-request@oneworld.wa.com.

           * 2.  Electronic Journals and Newsletters *
 
 
The Directory of Electronic Journals and Newsletters is
intended to provide a comprehensive listing of all
electronic journals and newsletters which are of academic
interest and available through BITNET, Internet and any
affiliated networks.  This Directory is part of an
ongoing project and is updated as new electronic journals
and newsletters come into existence and as existing
entries are changed.  Every effort has been made to
provide the user with up-to-date information.  Most
entries have been either provided from or scrutinized by
the journal and newsletter editors themselves to assure
accuracy.
 
     The primary intent of this Directory is to catalog
all existing electronic journals and newsletters that are
available over the various academic networks.  A
secondary intention is to catalog all e-serials that are
being produced over the commercial networks.  Thus, over
time this Directory will provide an entirely
comprehensive listing of all e-serials.  As the
traditional taxonomy of "journal" and "newsletter" is
ill-suited to the diversity of formats found within the
networks, a third category of "Hypercard Stacks,
Digest-Newsletters and Others" is included.  This section
catalogs hypercard stacks and other formats that
represent significant sources of information that are
similar in nature to journals and newsletters.  It should
be noted that digests which are straightforward
collections of conversational questions and answers are
considered to be a type of list, but any digests which
mix a simple list format with the newsletter format are
here included.
 
Ordinary (conversational) digests and lists are covered
in Diane Kovacs' compilation, Academic Discussion Lists
and Interest Groups, (see page ?).  Thus, no attempt has
been made to provide a comprehensive listing in this
Directory of the hundreds of existing digests and lists.

*  The Postmodern Jewish Philosophy BITNETWORK
 
 
     An electronic newsletter/journal of postmodern
     Judaism, philosophically considered, dedicated
     both to a philosophic review of the variety of
     postmodern Jewish discourses and to postmodern
     reflections on the variety of Jewish
     philosophies and Jewish philosophic
     theologies.  What "postmodern" means here is a
     question to be answered only in the doing. The
     three issues of Volume 1 of the BITNETWORK
     were devoted to reviews of what our members
     are doing -- that is, writing -- and to
     reflections on what this writing may indicate
     about the direction of postmodern Jewish
     philosophic practice. Volume 2.1 (Aug '92)
     presents this practice in three forms: a)
     "Dialogues in Postmodern Jewish Philosophy"--
     transcriptions of dialogues among our members
     on various issues in Jewish thought and
     theology.  Here, we are trying out dialogue as
     philosophic method: a kind of philosophic
     gemara, though we are yet to identify the
     mishnah; b) Philosophic Essays and Responses:
     we begin with excerpts from Adi Ophir's
     political theory of "distributive evils," with
     applications to Israeli political life;  c)
     Newsletter-like chattings about what we're up
     to.
 
     The journal works like something in-between
     the voluminous listserv journals and a
     standard newsletter-journal.  Members send
     materials electronically to the editor, who
     edits them into a journal format and then, 3
     times a year or so, sends them out to a
     distribution list of members and others who
     express interest. The BITNETWORK has also
     spawned a sister-dialogue group, called
     BITDIALOGUE and managed by Norbert Samuelson
     at Temple.  In this, members exchange words
     back and forth about various issues in
     postmodern Jewish philosophy.  The resulting
     dialogues are a source of ideas and sometimes
     of copy for the BITNETWORK.

*  Religious Studies Publications Journal - CONTENTS
 
 
     An all electronic, network distributed serial
     for Religious Studies
 
     * Purpose:
 
     To disseminate via the global computer
     networks;
 
     1) The table of contents, standard
          bibliographic information, abstracts
          and reviews of new and recent
          publications in Religious Studies
 
     2) Thesis and dissertations, subject
          bibliographies, glossaries, course
          syllabi and other pedagogical
          material.
 
     3) Software reviews of computer programs
          relevant to Religious Studies
          research
 
     4) Prepublication papers, dissertation
          abstracts, solicitations for
          manuscripts, and provide a central
          source of information on all
          networked documents of interest to
          Religious Studies and related
          fields.
 
     * Goal:
 
     To provide a comprehensive network
          distributed source of information on
          Religious Studies publications,
          pedagogical and research resources
          and software tools.
 
     * Overview:
 
     The Religious Studies Publications Journal -
     CONTENTS, subtitled the CONTENTS Project, is a
     networked electronic journal that brings
     together academic publishers and online
     scholars in Religious Studies and related
     fields. This journal provides an information
     service to academic publishers and the more
     than one thousand scholars in Religious
     Studies and related fields who are online with
     BITNET, Internet, and other international
     computer networks.  CONTENTS' primary function
     is the posting of table of contents, standard
     bibliographic, pricing and ordering
     information, abstracts and reviews of new
     books and journal issues of relevance to
     academics in the broad field of Religious
     Studies.  This electronic journal also
     publishes software reviews of programs
     essential to computer assisted research.
     CONTENTS extends the scope of electronic
     publication by combining reviews and abstracts
     with table of contents and ordering
     information of new books and journals in
     print.  Publishers are encouraged to provide
     an electronic mail contact address so as to
     enable CONTENTS' subscribers to order texts
     via the network.  This electronic journal is
     designed in anticipation of the developing
     commercialization of the academic networks and
     anticipates the growing trend within
     publishing houses of accommodating individual
     chapter and single article purchases.
 
     The CONTENTS Project operates by obtaining
     permission from participating publishers to
     scan the table of contents from new and recent
     books and journals and disseminates this
     information in electronic text to its
     subscribers.  To the table of contents is
     added information on the publisher, number of
     pages, price, abstracts and, if available,
     online ordering contact.  Publishers also are
     encourage to submit abstracts, book notes and
     reviews for electronic republication.
 
     CONTENTS will also disseminate and archive
     information on works in progress, conference
     announcements, solicitations for manuscripts,
     complete dissertations, bibliographies,
     networked documents and audio-visual resources
     of relevance to Religious Studies. All
     publication records posted by the CONTENTS
     Project are archived via LISTSERV at
     Listserv@Uottawa or
     Listserv@Acadvm1.Uottawa.Ca and may be
     searched or downloaded by the network
     community.  Eventually, all CONTENTS records
     will be fully searchable as an online public
     access database via TELNET.
 
     A supplement to CONTENTS, Lists in Review,
     provides an overview of many of the Listserv
     lists (online academic conferences) of
     relevance to Religious Studies.  A team of
     editors surveys individual lists and records
     lists of subject keywords that will serve to
     indicate what has been discussed on any given
     online conference.  These list summaries are
     compiled by the supplement editor and posted
     as a short file to CONTENTS and archived on a
     fileserver.  This collection will allow
     networked researchers to quickly survey what
     has been discussed on dozens of lists and then
     retrieve past conversations from a list's
     logbook.
 
     The list will not be conversational.
     Frequency of postings will depend on the
     number of cooperating publishers.
 
     At present, the Religious Studies Publications
     Journal - CONTENTS, has over seven hundred
     subscribers in more than twenty seven
     countries.

* OFFLINE
 
 
     Robert Kraft's OFFLINE column has appeared in
     printed form since 1984 in the Bulletin of the
     Council of Societies for the Study of Religion
     and in the Religious Studies News.  Despite
     its name, it also now appears in
     prepublication electronic form on the HUMANIST
     discussion list at the node BROWNVM and on the
     IOUDAIOS list at YORKVM1.  OFFLINE began as a
     service of the Computer Assisted Research
     Group of the Society of Biblical Literature,
     but it attempts to cover more widely the
     actual and potential use of computers in
     religious studies in general.  Currently, an
     editorial team often contributes items for
     inclusion in the column.
 
     There is no subscription list but if one is a
     member of either HUMANIST@BROWNVM or
     IOUDAIOS@YORKVM1 then it will be sent to you
     as it is issued to these lists.
 
* Back Issues:
 
     A complete set of OFFLINE issues can be
     retrieved via FTP from 137.122.6.16 in the
     directory /pub/religion/ as offline.zip
 
     Back issues are also available via Listserv
     from the HUMANIST filelist which can be
     obtained by issuing the command to
     Listserv@brownvm
 
     GET HUMANIST FILELIST
 
     You may obtain a copy by issuing the command

     LISTSERV AT BROWNVM GET filename filetype; if
     you are not on a VM/CMS system, send mail to
     ListServ@Brownvm with the GET command as the
     first and only line.

                  *  3.  Ecunet and PresbyNet *
 
This section will eventually provide comprehensive
information on North American denominational networks.
 
 
 
                         What is Ecunet?
 
Ecunet is a group of denominational and other "networks",
consisting of people who use computers to help them
communicate.  Individual members of Ecunet can send
electronic messages to around 2,000 other participants,
plus engage in electronic "meetings" or conferences.
There are currently about 15 denominations participating,
either officially or unofficially.  The cost of an
account on the system is $11 per month plus the cost of
long distance calls.
 
Ecunet is made up of the following denominational
networks:
 
     * American Baptist Network
     * Anglican/Episcopal Network
     * The Black Religious Studies Network
     * The Church of the Brethren
     * Disciples of Christ
     * The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
     * PresbyNet -- The Presbyterian Church (USA)
     * The United Church of Christ
     * The United Church of Canada
 
* Cost:   There is no sign up charge for
          Ecunet.  There is a monthly fee of
          $11.00 and a connect charge of
          $12.00 per hour of prime time usage
          (6 AM to 6 PM Monday to Friday) and
          $7.00 per hour of non-prime time
          usage.

                        What is PresbyNet?
 
PresbyNet is a network sponsored by the Stewardship and
Communication Ministry Unit of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.).  It consists of a dial-up host running
Participate software, which offers both electronic mail
and conferencing or "electronic meetings".  There are
currently no fees charged to Presbyterian members, other
than the cost of the long distance charges to call the
host in Louisville.  PresbyNet is used by a large
proportion of headquarters staff as well as regional
staff and members and pastors of some local
congregations.  In addition, PresbyNet is a part of
Ecunet, so Presbyterian members have access to all Ecunet
members.

*  Religious Studies Publications Journal - CONTENTS
 
 
     An all electronic, network distributed serial
     for Religious Studies
 
     * Purpose:
 
     To disseminate via the global computer
     networks;
 
     1) The table of contents, standard
          bibliographic information, abstracts
          and reviews of new and recent
          publications in Religious Studies
 
     2) Thesis and dissertations, subject
          bibliographies, glossaries, course
          syllabi and other pedagogical
          material.
 
     3) Software reviews of computer programs
          relevant to Religious Studies
          research
 
     4) Prepublication papers, dissertation
          abstracts, solicitations for
          manuscripts, and provide a central
          source of information on all
          networked documents of interest to
          Religious Studies and related
          fields.
 
     * Goal:
 
     To provide a comprehensive network
          distributed source of information on
          Religious Studies publications,
          pedagogical and research resources
          and software tools.
 
     * Overview:
 
     The Religious Studies Publications Journal -
     CONTENTS, subtitled the CONTENTS Project, is a
     networked electronic journal that brings
     together academic publishers and online
     scholars in Religious Studies and related
     fields. This journal provides an information
     service to academic publishers and the more
     than one thousand scholars in Religious
     Studies and related fields who are online with
     BITNET, Internet, and other international
     computer networks.  CONTENTS' primary function
     is the posting of table of contents, standard
     bibliographic, pricing and ordering
     information, abstracts and reviews of new
     books and journal issues of relevance to
     academics in the broad field of Religious
     Studies.  This electronic journal also
     publishes software reviews of programs
     essential to computer assisted research.
     CONTENTS extends the scope of electronic
     publication by combining reviews and abstracts
     with table of contents and ordering
     information of new books and journals in
     print.  Publishers are encouraged to provide
     an electronic mail contact address so as to
     enable CONTENTS' subscribers to order texts
     via the network.  This electronic journal is
     designed in anticipation of the developing
     commercialization of the academic networks and
     anticipates the growing trend within
     publishing houses of accommodating individual
     chapter and single article purchases.
 
     The CONTENTS Project operates by obtaining
     permission from participating publishers to
     scan the table of contents from new and recent
     books and journals and disseminates this
     information in electronic text to its
     subscribers.  To the table of contents is
     added information on the publisher, number of
     pages, price, abstracts and, if available,
     online ordering contact.  Publishers also are
     encourage to submit abstracts, book notes and
     reviews for electronic republication.
 
     CONTENTS will also disseminate and archive
     information on works in progress, conference
     announcements, solicitations for manuscripts,
     complete dissertations, bibliographies,
     networked documents and audio-visual resources
     of relevance to Religious Studies. All
     publication records posted by the CONTENTS
     Project are archived via LISTSERV at
     Listserv@Uottawa or
     Listserv@Acadvm1.Uottawa.Ca and may be
     searched or downloaded by the network
     community.  Eventually, all CONTENTS records
     will be fully searchable as an online public
     access database via TELNET.
 
     A supplement to CONTENTS, Lists in Review,
     provides an overview of many of the Listserv
     lists (online academic conferences) of
     relevance to Religious Studies.  A team of
     editors surveys individual lists and records
     lists of subject keywords that will serve to
     indicate what has been discussed on any given
     online conference.  These list summaries are
     compiled by the supplement editor and posted
     as a short file to CONTENTS and archived on a
     fileserver.  This collection will allow
     networked researchers to quickly survey what
     has been discussed on dozens of lists and then
     retrieve past conversations from a list's
     logbook.
 
     The list will not be conversational.
     Frequency of postings will depend on the
     number of cooperating publishers.
 
     At present, the Religious Studies Publications
     Journal - CONTENTS, has over seven hundred
     subscribers in more than twenty seven
     countries.

* OFFLINE
 
 
     Robert Kraft's OFFLINE column has appeared in
     printed form since 1984 in the Bulletin of the
     Council of Societies for the Study of Religion
     and in the Religious Studies News.  Despite
     its name, it also now appears in
     prepublication electronic form on the HUMANIST
     discussion list at the node BROWNVM and on the
     IOUDAIOS list at YORKVM1.  OFFLINE began as a
     service of the Computer Assisted Research
     Group of the Society of Biblical Literature,
     but it attempts to cover more widely the
     actual and potential use of computers in
     religious studies in general.  Currently, an
     editorial team often contributes items for
     inclusion in the column.
 
     There is no subscription list but if one is a
     member of either HUMANIST@BROWNVM or
     IOUDAIOS@YORKVM1 then it will be sent to you
     as it is issued to these lists.
 
* Back Issues:
 
     A complete set of OFFLINE issues can be
     retrieved via FTP from 137.122.6.16 in the
     directory /pub/religion/ as offline.zip
 
     Back issues are also available via Listserv
     from the HUMANIST filelist which can be
     obtained by issuing the command to
     Listserv@brownvm
 
     GET HUMANIST FILELIST
 
     You may obtain a copy by issuing the command
     -- GET filename filetype HUMANIST -- either
     interactively or as an e-mail message,
     addressed to ListServ@Brownvm.  Thus on a
     VM/CMS system, you say interactively:  TELL
     LISTSERV AT BROWNVM GET filename filetype; if
     you are not on a VM/CMS system, send mail to
     ListServ@Brownvm with the GET command as the
     first and only line.

                  *  3.  Ecunet and PresbyNet *
 
This section will eventually provide comprehensive
information on North American denominational networks.
 
 
 
                         What is Ecunet?
 
Ecunet is a group of denominational and other "networks",
consisting of people who use computers to help them
communicate.  Individual members of Ecunet can send
electronic messages to around 2,000 other participants,
plus engage in electronic "meetings" or conferences.
There are currently about 15 denominations participating,
either officially or unofficially.  The cost of an
account on the system is $11 per month plus the cost of
long distance calls.
 
Ecunet is made up of the following denominational
networks:
 
     * American Baptist Network
     * Anglican/Episcopal Network
     * The Black Religious Studies Network
     * The Church of the Brethren
     * Disciples of Christ
     * The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
     * PresbyNet -- The Presbyterian Church (USA)
     * The United Church of Christ
     * The United Church of Canada
 
* Cost:   There is no sign up charge for
          Ecunet.  There is a monthly fee of
          $11.00 and a connect charge of
          $12.00 per hour of prime time usage
          (6 AM to 6 PM Monday to Friday) and
          $7.00 per hour of non-prime time
          usage.
 
* Access: Set Baud rate to 2400 or higher

mcook%pcusa01@uunet.uu.net
 
 
                        What is PresbyNet?
 
PresbyNet is a network sponsored by the Stewardship and
Communication Ministry Unit of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.).  It consists of a dial-up host running
Participate software, which offers both electronic mail
and conferencing or "electronic meetings".  There are
currently no fees charged to Presbyterian members, other
than the cost of the long distance charges to call the
host in Louisville.  PresbyNet is used by a large
proportion of headquarters staff as well as regional
staff and members and pastors of some local
congregations.  In addition, PresbyNet is a part of
Ecunet, so Presbyterian members have access to all Ecunet
members.
