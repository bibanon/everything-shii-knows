The <a href="http://www.nist.gov/welcome.html"> National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> has developed an extensive set of test
programs to determine whether implementations of the Programmer's
Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS) conform to the
specifications of ANSI/ISO standard 9592.1-1989.  PHIGS is an application
programmer interface for 3D graphics.  NIST is making the documentation and
code for the <a
href="http://speckle.ncsl.nist.gov/~cugini/pvt/hy-top.html">PHIGS
Validation Tests</a> available on the World-Wide Web (WWW) and via
anonymous ftp.  NIST hopes to encourage more testing of PHIGS
implementations and the use of hypertext as a valuable medium for
navigating around the software and documentation.  For instance, users can
jump directly between a given part of the standard and the part of the PVT
that tests it.  Only the Fortran code is accessible in hypertext format.
The <a href="ftp://speckle.ncsl.nist.gov/pvt">entire PVT system</a>
(Fortran and C) may be obtained via anonymous FTP from site
speckle.ncsl.nist.gov under sub-directory pvt.  These tests are freely
