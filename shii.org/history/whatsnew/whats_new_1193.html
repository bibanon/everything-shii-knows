     Technology Services (ETS), SAS Computing in the School of Arts &
     Sciences at The University of Pennsylvania</A> would like to
     announce the formation of a Web server.  ETS supports the
     instructional and research computing and technology needs of the
     School of Arts & Sciences.  Incorporated in our server is the
     CCAT (Center for Computer Analysis of Texts, a sub-unit of ETS)
     Gopher server, containing one of the largest on-line text
     archives in the world. Other areas under development are the
     digital language lab, an attempt to distribute audio/video
     materials traditionally delivered in a cassette language lab,
     digitally over the internet; and the digital slide library, an
     initiative to make slides for History of Art and other courses
     using images available on the Internet.  The World Wide Web is
     the vehicle for these initiatives. <P>

     At the <A HREF="http://tbone.biol.scarolina.edu/">University of
     South Carolina</A> in Columbia, SC, <a
     href="http://tbone.biol.scarolina.edu/htbin/finger?dean2">Dean
     Pentcheff</a> has set up a Web server for (and of!) his lab, with
     a biologically oriented home page. If you are trying to get IBM
     PC users started with Internet connections, check out the <a
     href="http://tbone.biol.scarolina.edu/~dean2/kit/kit.html">DOS
     Internet Kit</a> there.  It's a self-installing package for
     Ethernet-connected PCs that includes current versions of NCSA
     Telnet, PC Gopher, Trumpet Winsock, Windows Mosaic, and LView
     (with configuration instructions and pointers to update sites).
     <P>

     The <A HREF="http://www.internic.net/internic.html">InterNIC</A>

     Kevin Hughes at Honolulu has put up a <A
     HREF="http://pulua.hcc.hawaii.edu/plotd"><I>Interactive
     Geographical Index</I></A> -- he says: "It's a world map - click
     on where you're from <I>once</I>, and a little dot will appear
     where you clicked. You may already see some dots where others
     have clicked.  Below the map are the addresses of the people who
     clicked on the map - select any address and you'll see the
     location on the map (with one dot this time) where they clicked.
     Anyway, in time the map should be pretty full of dots and look
     rather cool, sort of a visual guest book!"  It is, of course,
     strictly experimental. <P>

     A Web server has been opened at the <A

     analytical programs, and other resources. <P>
