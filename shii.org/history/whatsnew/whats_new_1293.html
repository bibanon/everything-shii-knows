     In 1849, while constructing the first railroad between Rutland
     and Burlington, Vermont, workers unearthed the bones of a
     mysterious animal near the town of Charlotte. These bones proved
     to be the fossilized remains of a beluga whale. What's a whale
     doing in Vermont, some 150 miles inland from the sea? Thanks to
     the University of Vermont's Division of Computing and Information
