MEERC functions as nucleus for an ample mix of research projects
concerned with environmental issues on the coastal zone. MEERC
upholds multidisciplinary research evaluating the scale-dependence of
ecosystem responses to pollutant inputs. General principles of ecosystem
structure, function and dynamics are tested over a range of spatial,
temporal and complexity scales. Simulation models are used, simultaneously
along with experimental systems, to investigate ecosystem responses to
pollutant perturbations. These experimental systems range from small-scale
laboratory cosms (&lt;1 sq. m) to large-scale watershed cosms (sq. km).<p>
