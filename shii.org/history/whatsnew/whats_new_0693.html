<DD> A <A HREF="http://cui_www.unige.ch/home.html">Web server</A> has
        been installed at the Centre Universitaire d'Informatique of the
        University of Geneva.  Information about various research groups at
        the CUI is available, as well as a number of other experimental
        services.
<DT> June 24, 1993
<DD> The Institute for Theoretical Physics at 
        State University of New York at Stony Brook is now running a
        <A HREF="http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/home.html">Web
        server</A>.  Included is <A

        Institute news bulletins</A>, a directory of <A

        HyTelnet 6.5 is now online; see <A
        HREF="http://info.cern.ch:8002/w3start.txt">here</A>. <P>

        If you haven't tried it yet, take a look at the <A
        HREF="http://jh.ccs.neu.edu:7043/">Web server</A> running
        inside <A
        HREF="telnet://jayshouse.ccs.neu.edu:1709/">JaysHouseMOO</A>.
        See particularly the <A
        HREF="http://jh.ccs.neu.edu:7043/browser_object/objnum!%23224">object
        browser</A>.  (For those unfamiliar with the term, a MOO is a
        "consensual text-based virtual reality", aka MUD or Multi-User
        Dungeon, wherein people interact with one other in a
        computer-enabled world.  Since these systems commonly feature
        rich and extensible programming environments, it is possible
        to build Web, Gopher, and other servers (and clients!)
        directly into the online virtual world.  Another example of
        this is the <A
        HREF="gopher://actlab.rtf.utexas.edu:3452/">Gopher server</A>
        running inside the <A
        HREF="telnet://actlab.rtf.utexas.edu:4000/">Actuator</A> MUD;

<DD>         A new server at Georgia Tech is <A

        particular <A
        HREF="http://merlin.gatech.edu/subject.html">resources by
        subject</A>.  Most of the stuff in there is off limits to
        off-site people -- bummer.  But not a hypermedia version of <A

<DD> NCSA Mosaic's developers humbly ask people who refer to NCSA Mosaic
        in their online or printed documents to refer to it by its
        given name -- "NCSA Mosaic" -- rather than "xmosaic" or
        "Xmosaic".  This helps us in a couple different ways,
        including keeping our management happy. <P>

        Also, anyone who is using Mosaic in a real world project
        (education, research, commercial, etc.) is encouraged to drop
        us a line at <B>mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu</B>; details on how
        people are really using our software help us immensely,
        especially when it comes time to go for funding to let us
        build more and better software for you to use.  Thanks in
        advance!

<DD> A new version of the public group/community annotation server
        running on <B>hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8001</B> has been put in

        automatically provided in new annotations.  (For
        information on the public annotation server, see <A

        A discussion of some
        design issues in group/community annotation systems, including
        the collision of WWW annotation systems and news, is now <A
        HREF="../Notes/group-annotation-issues.html">here</A>;
        currently there are discussions of <A
        HREF="../Notes/annotations-and-news.html">a Usenet approach to
        global annotations</A>, and <A
        HREF="../Notes/notification.html">notification methods</A> for
        tracking annotation activity.
