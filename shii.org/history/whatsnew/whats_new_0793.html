"Space is limited in a newspaper because of the cost of paper and
production, but the electronic version has a selection of related
articles... Readers can communicate directly with writers, both by
electronic mail and a live chat period - a group conversation
conducted online through personal computers."  <I>Newsday</I> is currently
publishing via the interactive Delphi information system.  To access
