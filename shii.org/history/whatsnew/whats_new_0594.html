Unless you are sitting in Milano, Italia, you're not in a city that
produces as much <B>coffee</B> as <B>Seattle</B>, Washington, USA.  You

espresso cart.  I'm convinced that this is due to our much fabled weather.  It
takes a city that is overcast and gloomy a large percentage of the time to
produce really good bean juice. Thus far the
