<LI><A HREF="http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/htw/htw-demos.html"><B>Virtual
documents</B> about how things work</A>.  Using model-based reasoning and
machine-generated explanation technology, these documents explain the behavior
and structure of engineered systems (e.g., thrusters on the NASA space
shuttle, power generation plants).  They dynamically generate answers, in
natural language, to questions as the reader browses the document.  These are
true virtual documents in that they are generated from underlying models and
are not simply remote user interfaces to conventional software.
