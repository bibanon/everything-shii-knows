The <A HREF="http://fits.cv.nrao.edu/www/astroweb.html">AstroWeb Consortium</A> 
would like to announce a new World Wide Web resource <I>AstroWeb</I> which contains 
links to Internet Resources of use to the Astronomy community.
AstroWeb is available at:
<A HREF="http://fits.cv.nrao.edu/www/astronomy.html">NRAO</A>, 
<A HREF="http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/astroweb.html">CDS</A>, 
<A HREF="http://meteor.anu.edu.au/anton/astronomy.html">MSSSO</A>, 
<A HREF="http://ecf.hq.eso.org/astro-resources.html">ST-ECF</A>, and 
<A HREF="http://stsci.edu/net-resources.html">STScI</A>.  
It merges the resource listings which have been
maintained at CDS, MSSSO, NRAO, STECF, and STScI.  This merging
of effort provides a more complete resource listing
and eliminates the need to check several different
listings.
The AstroWeb database currently contains about 650 resource
records, about 185 kilobytes of text.
Each resource is categorized, e.g., Data and Archive Centers, 
Astronomy Departments, Space Agencies, ...
Many resources have a paragraph describing the resource
and containing links to other URLs.
There is a <A HREF="http://stsci.edu/search-master.html">searchable version</A>
of the merged resource listing. 
There are HTML forms by which new resources can be
added and existing resources can be edited.<p>
