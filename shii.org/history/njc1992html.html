                          NOT JUST COWS

A Guide to Internet/Bitnet Resources in Agriculture
 and 
Related Sciences 


Written and compiled by Wilfred Drew.
                          June 23, 1992


The purpose of this guide to direct the user to resources in agriculture
that are available on the INTERNET or BITNET.  

In several places this guide is uses examples specific to the VAX VMS
environment.  This is because Morrisville College uses the VAX.  It would be
impossible to cover all possible variations on system specific commands or
unusual implementations.

Please feel free to copy this guide in any format as long as credit is given
to me.  I worked hard on this guide and expect to get credit for it.  The guide
is copyright free.

Please contact me if there are any questions.

How this guide was produced:

This guide was written and compiled entirely on a microcomputer and our
local VAX.  Except for my initial list of libraries with holdings in
agriculture, all information is from sources on the INTERNET.  Sample
screens were captured using QVT.  The original document is written in
WordPerfect 5.1 format.  The ascii version is derived from that file.

INTERNET/BITNET TOOLS


Tools needed to access services on the INTERNET or BITNET:


GOLD-MAIL (I prefer this to VMS MAIL mentioned further below under MAIL.
This information was taken from the GOLD-MAIL help screens on our VAX.)

  Gold-Mail is a VMSmail compatible electronic mail system.

  The menus are "pulled down" from the menu bar by pressing the underlined
(first) letter in Gold, Message, Send, Output, Utilities, or Customize.

  Menu options can be selected by typing the underlined letter in the
option's name, or using the arrow keys and pressing RETURN.  The CANCEL
key (F20 or <CTRL-Z>) may be pressed to cancel a menu without performing a
command.

  Mail messages are organized into drawers and folders.  Folders may be
created when moving or copying mail messages.  Folders may be opened and
closed by placing the highlighting on the folder name and pressing RETURN. 
Mail messages may be read by moving the highlighting to the desired
message and pressing RETURN.  Operations may be performed on multiple
messages by selecting them using the SELECT key (numeric keypad "." key).

(End of extract from Gold_Mail help screens)

GoldMail is started by:  $ gmail


MAIL (taken from the VMS MAIL help screens on our VAX. These will be
different for other systems).

    Invokes the VMS Personal Mail Utility (MAIL), which is used  to send
messages  to other users of the system.   For a complete description of  the 
VMS  Personal  Mail   Utility, including information about the MAIL command
and  its  qualifiers,  see the  VMS Mail Utility Manual.

(End of extract from VAX help files)

FTP (taken from the FTP help screens on our VAX. These will be different for
other systems).

    FTP is the user interface to the ARPANET standard file transfer
protocol.  FTP allows users to log into remote systems, transfer files to
and from remote hosts, obtain listings of directories on remote hosts, and
other common file operations.

    The FTP utility supports two styles of user interfaces, a    DCL command
interface and a ULTRIX command interface.  The DCL command interface is
the default.  To select the ULTRIX command    interface, define a symbol as
follows:

     $ FTP :== $UCX$FTP/ULTRIX

    Most FTP commands require one or more file specifications.  Local file
specifications must be valid VAX/VMS file specifications. Remote file
specifications will be interpreted by the remote host and therefore must be
valid to that host.  Any file specification which is not a valid VAX/VMS file
specification must be quoted.
   
(End of excerpt from VAX help file)

Sample FTP session using ULTRIX interface: (my comments wil appear in bold)

$ ftp hydra.uwo.ca   <==  Same command would be entered in DCL interface. This
command is entered at the prompt. The address of the remote system here is
hydra.uwo.ca. 


Response from remote system:

220 HYDRA.UWO.CA MultiNet FTP Server Process 3.0(12) at Thu 7-May-92
11:48AM-GMT 

Connected to HYDRA.UWO.CA.  

Name (hydra.uwo.ca:drewwe): anonymous <== Enter anonymous at this prompt.
331 anonymous user ok. Send real ident as password. 
Password:  <== Enter your e-mail address. It will not be visible.

230-Guest User DREWWE@SNYMORVA.BITNET logged into PUB:[000000] at Thu 
7-May-92  
11:48, job 5793.

226 Transfer completed.  7896 (8) bytes transferred. 
local: ftp_guide.txt remote: ftp_guide.txt 
7896 bytes received in 00:00:10.67 seconds  
ftp> quit <==  Ending session
221 QUIT command received. Goodbye. 
$ <==  Back at VAX prompt


TELNET (taken from the TELNET help screens on our VAX. These will be
different for other systems).

    TELNET is a remote login protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It allows
a user on one host to establish a connection with a remote host and
interact as if the user's terminal is connected directly to the remote host.

 
(End of extract from TELNET help screens)

No sample session is shown for telnet because of the wide variety of
services available via telnet.
See the separate sections of this guide for more details.

LIBRARIES WITH EXTENSIVE COLLECTIONS IN AGRICULTURE

Why search library catalogs on the INTERNET?

There are several reasons to search OPACs on the INTERNET:

1. Our collection is relatively small and you can access farlarger
collections such as Mann Library at Cornell University.

2. Many libraries have mounted unique databases such as the ones on CARL
(Colorado Alliance of Libraries).

3. If you were to access any of these by modem and telephone it would be a
long distance call.  Access through the INTERNET does not cost you
anything.

4. It allows you to check out a distant library with out leaving your office.


The following list of library catalogs is extracted and adapted from UNT's
Accessing On-Line Bibliographic Databases.  These catalogs were selected
because they have relatively large collections in agriculture or contain
other unique and useful features.  

Note:  Since our campus does not have TN3270 on our VAX,  use the gateway
at Washington University -- St. Louis for access to some of the TN3270
systems. It is the last entry in this list.

INTERNET ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARDS


Electronic bulletin boards are simply ways of "posting" items for others to
see.  Many services are available throught them including full text files on
various topics, databases, and other services.  I have included here sample
screens from three bulletin boards related to agriculture.

Cattle-Fax, a market information service, has estimated that ground beef
will account for 43% of the beef consumed by the average American in 1991.
Average per capita consumption of ground beef (including hamburger and
beef used in processed products) will be an estimated 29 lbs. Consumption
of steaks and roasts will be an estimated 38.2 lbs., retail weight.

Thus, average per capita consumption of beef, on a boneless, edible-weight
basis. is expected to be 63.5 lbs. in 1991. Other estimates for 1991 on a
boneless-weight basis include 43.1 lbs. of pork and 51.4 lbs. of chicken.
In terms of per capita expenditures also, beef is the leading meat.
Americans spent an average of $189.39 for beef in 1990, equal to the
combined expenditures for pork and chicken.

MAIL BASED SERVICES

Note: The following instructions for using Almanac and listserv were
excerpted 
from EXPLORING INTERNET: An Extension Agents' Introduction to Networking.
 
     Mailing groups, forums, discussion groups, and listservers are special
interest groups where questions or issues are sent to the group via e-mail.
Members of the group discuss the topic while all members observe the
dialog.
Some lists are more active than others and after subscribing to a list you
may
receive few or dozens of e-mail messages weekly. Mailing groups are
available
through Almanac. Listservers are available through Internet and BITNET.

     It's recommended that if you subscribe to a group or list that you have a
personal e-mail account. Remember when you reply to a question posted by a
member, your message is placed in the mailbox of every member of the group.

     Another type of mailing group available is a "server." Almanac servers
are
designed for one-way communications only.  They are typically used by an
author
to distribute newsletters or news releases. * Do not send mail to Almanac
mailing group servers.
 
HOW TO: Subscribe to an Almanac Mailing Group
 
     1.  Send an e-mail message to almanac@oes.orst.edu OR
  almanac@ecn.purdue.edu OR almanac@esusda.gov
   * Each site maintains a Mailing List Catalog for their
     location.
 
     2.  In the body of your message type the following:
  send mail-catalog
   * The Mailing List Catalog describes the mailing groups
     available at that site.
   * Items designated as "servers" are reserved for one-way
     communications. Subscribing to a "server" list is similar to
     signing up for to a newspaper or magazine subscription.  As
     new information is published you will receive a copy in your
     e-mail box.
   * Items designated as "forums" are  discussion groups or
     interest groups.
 
     3.  Send an e-mail message to the Almanac site where the mailing
  group you wish to join is located.
 
     4.  In the body of your message type the following: subscribe and
  the name of the group. For example to subscribe to Ag A.M. you
  would type the following: subscribe usda.agam

facilitate communications between
life scientists. This list will have
three main functions.  1) It can be
used to ask questions about
networking addresses of
scientists in the biological life
sciences. 2) If you have small
databases of E-mail addresses
related to your field of interest
they can be uploaded. 3) If you
subscribe you will be asked to send
ONE MESSAGE to BIO-NAUT which
gives a brief outline of who you
are and your main interests.
Instructions on the format of this
MESSAGE will be sent to all
subscribers individually.

POP-BIO@IRLEARN POPULATION-
BIOLOGY
Population Biology is a synthesis
of population ecology and
population genetics, pursuing a
unified theory to explain the
structure, functioning and
evolution of populations of living
beings. Such populations are very
complex systems, exhibiting a
variety of phenomena that we stil
do not master. Just to quote a
famous example, multiannual
density cycles (e.g. in lemmings)
have not received a satisfactory
expalnation, despite of decades of
debated studies and speculations.
Population Biology is a very active
field, encompassing such diverse
approaches as tenacious, harsh
field work to track long term
demographic and genetic
fluctuations, or sophisticated
conversations with a computer
about strange attractors possibly
causing chaos in the density
fluctuations.

OTHER IMPORTANT SERVICES
Miscellaneous services of interest

The WAIS service below is important because the number of datbases is
contstantly growing.
There are WAIS stes available but this one is the best in my opinion.

Wide Area Information Server at THINK.COM

(Information below from HYTLENET-- see works cited.)

To connect, type  Telnet QUAKE.THINK.COM or 192.31.181.1
login: wais
Please type user identifier (optional, i.e user@host):

TERM = (unknown) vt100

The WAIS (Wide Area Information Service) system is a collection of
programs which provide for convenient information distribution over wide
area networks. Tools for both "publishing" and accessing information
sources are provided. The Simple WAIS (SWAIS) interface is a basic
access tool designed for those focused on data retreival and not
computer operation. It provides most of the functionality of the more
complicated interfaces but features a simple and potentially more
natural interface.  The functionality supported includes source
selection, keyword entry, and automatic document retrieval. I hope that
this tool may be of use.  Enjoy.

The WAIS system is the result of a joint project between Thinking
Machines, Apple Computer, and Dow Jones.  For more information on WAIS,
send mail to "wais-discussion@think.com".  The current release of the
WAIS software is available via anonymous ftp from think.com in
subdirectory wais.

Geographic Name Server, Copyright 1989, 1990 Merit Inc.  All rights
reserved.

Data came primarily from the US Geodetic Survey and the US Postal Service.
Coverage includes all US cities, counties, and states, as well as some US
mountains, rivers, lakes, national parks, etc. A few international cities
have also been included. Unfortunately, some minor inaccuracies remain. 
Merit Inc. is not responsible for maintaining this data.

Queries should generally look like the last line of a postal address, as in
"Ann Arbor, MI 48103".

All these queries will also work:
1) ed(1)-style regular expression, like "[Bb]os.*n$"
2) A city name alone, like "Ann Arbor"
3) A ZIP or ZIP+4 code alone, like this: "46556", "48103-2112" NOTE: only the
first 5 digits in a ZIP+4 code are used.
4) As in 1) or 2) but with a state name or abbreviation, like this: "Ann Arbor,
MI", "Los Angeles, California"
5) As above but with optional nation name or abbreviation, like "Toronto, ,
Canada".  NOTE:  there are currently very few foreign cities.

Punctuation, white space, and upper/lower case are ignored. Any reasonable
state/nation abbreviations are recognized.

If a query fails, try expanding abbreviations (e.g. change "Mt."to "Mount",
etc.

Interpret server replies as follows:

0 [city name]
1 [county FIPS code] [county name]
2 [state/province abbreviation] [state/province name]
3 [nation abbreviation] [nation name]
A [telephone area code]
E [elevation in feet above mean sea level]
F [feature code] [feature name]
L [latitude DD MM SS X] [longitude DDD MM SS X]
P [1980 census population]
R [remark]
T [time zone]
Z [postal ("ZIP") code]
