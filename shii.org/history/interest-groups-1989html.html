SUMMARY OF MAILING-LISTS IN THIS FILE:

   ***************************************************************************

   **This gets you to the Coordinator, rather than to the membership of the **
   **entire mailing list.  Please look carefully at the entry for each list **
   **you are interested in, to see if a -REQUEST address has been provided. **

AAI@ST-LOUIS-EMH2.ARMY.MIL

   Digest for discussion of the Automated AUTODIN Interface system.  The AAI 
   system is a series of programs that interface a data processing 
   installation (DPI) with an AUTODIN switching center.  This digest will 
   provide information to the user community and other personnel interested in
   the developments/enhancements and implementation thereof.

   The AAI-Digests (and past AAI-Digest files contained in the Archive 
   directory) are organized by Volume # and Issue #.  Information was 
   informally disseminated prior to the initiation of the AAI digest, and 
   those newsletters stored in the aai account Archive directory can be 
   requested by reference to month and year.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to AAI@ST-LOUIS-EMH2.ARMY.MIL.

ADA-SW@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   A mailing list for those who in accessing and contributing software to the 
   Ada Repository on SIMTEL20; it serves two purposes: to provide an 
   information exchange medium between the repository users and to mail 
   repository submissions to the Coordinator for inclusion in the archives.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   ADA-SW-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   The Ada Repository is divided into several subdirectories.  These 
   directories are organized by topic, and their names and a brief overview of
   their topics are contained in file PD:<ADA.GENERAL>DIRLIST.DOC.

ADVISE-L%CANADA01.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   Unmoderated mailing list intended for discussion among students who work 
   part-time at the various university computer centers.  It is particularly 
   intended for people who work as student advisors or consultants, although 
   others are welcome.  Another use of the list is to get help from others on 
   problems that might be encountered, or to let everyone know about new 
   things such as new file servers, so that everyone can put the network to 
   the best possible use.

   Alternate paths/addresses: The list is served by 5 servers 
   (ADVISE-L@UTORONTO, ADVISE-L@CANADA01, ADVISE-L@NCSUVM, ADVISE-L@UGA, and 
   MD4F@CMUCCVMA) which are peer linked so that anything sent to one will be 
   sent to the other two automatically.  ADVISE-L@NCSUVM is probably the 
   closest server to the CUNYVM ARPANet gateway.

   To subscribe to the list:

      From a VM site on BITNET do:
         TELL LISTSERV at CANADA01 SUBSCRIBE ADVISE-L Your_Full_Name
      where Your_Full_Name is your real name (not your userid).

      From a VMS BITNET site use the SEND/REMOTE command.

      If you are at a site not on bitnet or where you cannot send interactive 
      messages you can send a message to 
      LISTSERV%CANADA01.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU where the first non-header line
      consists of:
         SUBSCRIBE ADVISE-L Your_Full_Name

ALLMUSIC%AUVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list is dedicated to the discussion of all forms of music, in all 
   its aspects.  It's founding is based on the understanding that most people 
   who listen to and enjoy music do so from a variety of standpoints, and that
   a general, unlimited forum is desirable for both the integration and 
   expansion of musical ideas, techniques, and understanding.  Therefore, all 
   topics having to do with music are welcome, including but not limited to: 
   composition, performance, recording; research, critique, inquiry, advocacy,
   instrument design, ethnomusicology, psychacoustics, orchestration, jazz, 
   classical, funk, plainchant, and anything else you can think of.  If a 
   topic is running that you have something to say about, or to question, jump
   in.  If you have something entirely different in mind, start up another 
   thread.  Music is universal.  With the advent of electronic communication, 
   so are we.

   To be added to or deleted from the list, send mail to the Coordinator.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   AMETHYST-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST-USERS>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

AMNESTY%JHUVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list to distribute Amnesty International's urgent action appeals, 
   usually one per month.  They are 1 or 2-page summaries of a specific case 
   of human rights abuse, such as a small group of people who have been 
   arrested without reason, or are being held secretly, or tortured, etc. They
   give the prisoners' names, why they were arrested, who to write to, and 
   what they suggest you say.  Amnesty International is concerned with human 
   rights, not just amnesty.  Sometimes they ask members to write letters 
   requesting not freedom, but better or more just treatment.  You don't have 
   to be a member of, or endorse, Amnesty International to receive this list. 
   Additional discussion or information from other organizations may be 
   distributed.

   To subscribe, send the following command to LISTSERV@JHUVM:

   book "Animal Liberation" proposes a "New Ethics for our Treatment of 
   Animals" and many activist groups, such as PETA (People for the Ethical 
   Treatment of Animals), regard this as the "Bible of the Animal Rights 
   movement".  Consumers and researches alike are facing new questions 
   concerning the human animals' treatment of the rest of the animal kingdom. 
   The purpose of this list is to provide students, researchers, and 
   activists, a forum for discussing issues like:

      Animal Rights                   Animal Liberation
      Consumer Product Testing        Cruelty-free products

ANSAXNET <VM47C2@WVNVM.WVNET.EDU>

   ANSAXNET is a SIG (Special Interest Group) for scholars of the culture and 
   history of England before 1100 C.E.   Scholars interested in the later 
   English Middle Ages and those interested in the early Medieval period 
   throughout Europe are also encouraged to join the list.  Members receive a 
   directory of all our members in order to facilitate telecommunications, and
   a monthly electronic report to which they are encouraged to contribute 
   announcements and information.  This report often provides members with new
   information about the use of computers in some aspect of their disciplines,
   as well as news of more conventional developments in the field.  We also 
   have projects underway to encode databases which members may use in their 
   own work.  To this end, we are now working on the details of distributing 
   to the membership a database of all manuscripts written or owned in England
   before 1100.  We would be glad to add your name to our directory and thus 
   to make you a member of ANSAXNET.  Membership is free to everyone with 
   access to a BITNET node.

   Anyone who wants to be a member of ANSAXNET should send e-mail to the 
   Coordinator, including a conventional mailing address and some information 
   about your particular interests in early medieval cultural studies.

ARPANET-BBOARDS@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

   Redistribution address for all known BBoards on the ARPANET.  The 
   guidelines for postings are somewhat loose.  The ostensible purpose of the 
   list is to distribute: (a) emergency notices ("Southern California just 
   slid into the Pacific, machines at ISI and UCSD will be down for a few 
   days"), and (b) notices of "academic interest", such as seminar and 
   symposium announcements.  Advertisements and for-profit notices are not 
   appropriate (the DoD would get upset, among other considerations).  A 
   touchy borderline case is job offerings.  The practice has been to accept 
   postings from universities (the research community) and the research 
   oriented military installations (the people paying for our hardware) but to
   refuse postings from private companies.  The (shaky) rationale behind this 
   is that university and military job offerings are "research opportunities" 
   as opposed to for-profit advertisements (ie, joining the army or a 
   university is not the way to get rich).

   Anyone is welcome to redistribute Arpanet-BBoards; it takes some of the 
   (considerable) load off of MC's mailer.  But please don't do it without 
   sending a message to the -Request address first.

   There are Archive copies of every message ever sent to the list but no 
   guarantee is made that they will be online or available at any particular 
   time.  The current archive file, such as it is, can be found as 
   "COMAIL;BBOARD ARCHIV" on MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to the Coordinators.  Bitnet users may subscribe to 
   the list by doing:
      TELL LISTSERV at RUTVM1 SUBSCRIBE ARPABBS Your_Full_Name
   where Your_Full_Name is your real name (not your userid).  From a VMS

ASSMPC-L%USACHVM1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list for issues related to the PC Assembly languages (Intel 
   8086/88/286/386/...).  There is an initial programming goal that the 
   managers of this list wish to accomplish:

      We are inviting all users to assist in the coding of projects.  For 
      instance, our first task will be a Resident Program Manager.  We will 
      use Turbo Assembler or MacroAssembler to develop the applications.

      A second project will be an AV package to viruses, we already have 
      programs for Jerusalem and Brain, these could be help for it.

   The users of this list will receive mail with code contributions and 
   discussions, and eventually the program source listing finished with the 
   help of the participants.  Then, the list will propose a new project to 
   work on.  Any and all code contributions, ideas, and anything else that 
   will help in achieving this opening goal will be appreciated, discussed, 
   reported and acknowledged for the list.

   BitNet users can subscribe non-interactively by sending a message or mail 
   to LISTSERV@USACHVM1.BITNET with the text/body of the message being:

      BIO-SOFTWARE                 BIO-SOFT            bionet.software

   The BIO-SOFTWARE newsgroup is not moderated.  Questions, answers, and 
   discussions are welcomed about software related to the biological sciences 
   (or even about problems with other software that scientists might use in 
   the course of their work such as word processors or communications 
   software).

   To subscribe to this newsgroup, please send your subscription request to 
   one of the following addresses; if you previously received e-mail from any 
   of the three superceded groups, then you should have been subscribed to 
   BIO-SOFTWARE.  If you have any questions or doubts about this, please 
   contact the applicable BIOSCI address below:

   Mailing list for members of the International, European, American, Canadian
   and other Societies of Biomechanics, and for others with an interest in the
   general field of biomechanics and human or animal movement science.  For 
   the scope of this list, see, e.g., the Journal of Biomechanics (Pergamon 
   Press), the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering (ASME), and Human Movement
   Science (North-Holland).

BIOMED-L%NDSUVM1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list for discussion on the topic of Biomedical Ethics.  Since the 
   field of medicine and medical technology are rapidly changing and the field
   is so broad, it is difficult to have clearly delineated rules as to what 
   should and should not be discussed, but possible topics might include:
      Paternalism             Fetal Cell Transplant
      The Right to Die        AIDS
      Suicide                 Patient Autonomy
      Abortion                Drug Legalization
      Euthanasia              Respirator Withdrawal
      Transplants             Allocation of scarce resources
   and many others too numerous to list here.  The discussions may be ethical,
   philosophical, religious, political, social or even, in some cases, 
   personal.  Open discussion, disagreement, and dissent is encouraged.  Open 
   flames are most certainly *not*.

   To subscribe to BIOMED-L send the following command to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1:
      SUBSCRIBE BIOMED-L your_full_name
   where your_full_name is your real name, not your userid.  Non-BitNet users 
   can subscribe by sending the above command in the text/body of a message to
   LISTSERV%NDSUVM1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

BIOSPH-L%UBVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   This list replaces the now defunct list OZONE@ICNUCEVM.  The new name 
   reflects better the topics discussed.  Anything relating to the biosphere, 
   pollution, CO-2 effect, ecology, habitats, climate, etc., can be discussed.
    Basically anything that exerts an influence of some kind or another on the
   BioSphere.

   New archives will be stored in a monthly notebook.  Archives from the old 
   Ozone List will eventually be transferred to the BIOSPH-L site.  Even 
   though there is no longer a connection to the owners of the old list, the 
   idea is to continue on from the topics that were being discussed up to when
   it went dead.

   To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@UBVM.BITNET:
      SUBSCRIBE BIOSPH-L Your_full_name
   To leave or signoff the list send:
      SIGNOFF BIOSPH-L
   Non-BitNet users can [un]subscribe by sending the commands in the body text
   of a message to LISTSERV%UBVMS.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

CLASS-L%SBCCVM.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   Mailing list and file server for researchers in classification, clustering,
   phylogenetic estimation, and related areas of data analysis.  CLASS-L 
   provides facilities to:

      - Enable researchers to mail messages automatically to all subscribers
      - Provide researchers with announcements, newsletters, and information
        about classification and clustering.

   The Coordinators are inviting officials of professional classification 
   societies to own (and to be responsible for) files which would be 
   maintained by the SBCCVM file server.  Any CLASS-L subscriber can retrieve 
   these files by issuing appropriate LISTSERV commands.  Alternatively, a 
   CLASS-L subscriber can arrange to receive automatically copies (or 
   announcements) of files updated by particular societies.  We hope officials
   of the Member Societies of the International Federation of Classification 
   Societies will eventually participate in this project as file owners.  
   Officials from other societies (e.g. Psychometric Society, Willi Hennig 
   Society, International Association of Pattern Recognition Societies) may 
   also be interested in participating.

   To subscribe to CLASS-L, send the command:
      SUB CLASS-L your_full_name
   to LISTSERV@SBCCVM  e.g.  SUB CLASS-L "William H. E. Day"
   To have your name removed from the CLASS-L subscriber list, send:
      SIGNOFF CLASS-L
   Commands can be sent to LISTSERV@SBCCVM either as interactive messages or 
   in e-mail (one command per line in the body of the e-mail message).

ETHICS-L%MARIST.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   Discussions of ethics in computing usually generate more heat than light.  
   This list could do a lot toward generating more light if we do more than 
   trade war stories and opinions of the "I'm right and you're NOT" variety.  
   Of course we can't get any work done without some war stories, since they 
   furnish food for thought.  But we shouldn't stop there.  Given our 
   experiences, we ought to be able to delineate the basic issues and hot 
   areas in computer ethics.  Some current ones have to do with:

      - ownership of information (both data and program files)
      - what happens when systems programs fail? Is anyone responsible for
        damage done?  Or is the responsibility only for the necessary fix?
      - responsibility for program failures (Is the company responsible?
        the programmer? the lead programmer? the project manager?) Who's
        responsible for the "fix"?
      - how much privacy is reasonable (there are all kinds of levels here;
        data bases, systems, LANs, networks, etc.)

   BitNet users can add themselves to the list by issuing the following 
   command to LISTSERV@MARIST.BITNET:
      SUBSCRIBE ETHICS-L your_full_name
   where your_full_name is your real name (not your userid).
   BitNet users can unsubscribe with the command:

   be taken seriously unless they can introduce radically better evidence than
   creationists have in the past, we have no agreement to limit discussion of 
   contraversal topics.  The coordinator assumes no responsibility for

   The "Fusion" list is for discussion of nuclear fusion.  It is a 
   BitNet/NetNorth/EARN Redistribution list relayed from the list 
   fusion@ZORCH.UUCP (fusion%zorch@UUNET.UU.NET), which is gatewayed with the 
   "alt.fusion" usenet newsgroup.

   NOTE: Submissions to the Fusion list should be sent to fusion@ZORCH.UUCP 
   (fusion%zorch@uunet.uu.net).

   Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived.  You can obtain
   a list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX FUSION" command 
   to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.  These files can then be retrieved by means of a "GET 
   FUSION filetype" command, or using the database search facilities of 
   LISTSERV.  Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for more information on the 
   latter.

   You may also obtain copies of the list notebooks via anonymous FTP to 
   VM1.NoDak.EDU (192.33.18.30), userid ANONYMOUS, any password.  Once 
   validated do a CD LISTARCH and DIR FUSION.* to see the notebooks available.
    The file system is NOT hierarchical so you must do a CD ANONYMOUS if you 
   want to return to the "root".

   You may subscribe to FUSION by sending the command:
      SUB FUSION Your_full_name     (eg. SUB FUSION Jane Doe)
   to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 (or LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU).  The command may be in the

   A forum for a broad discussion about James Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE.  The 
   James Joyce Institute of Ireland's Finnegans Wake Study Group has been 
   doing their best to get the jokes in Finnegans Wake for the past decade or 
   so.  The Study Group thinks it is time for such groups to pool their 
   findings.

   There are plans to start a second associated service to share page-by-page,
   line-by-line notes to the text of FINNEGANS WAKE in a fixed format 
   analogous to that of Roland McHugh's ANNOTATIONS.  The Coordinator is 
   working on a program to vet the mail from such a service.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from the mailing list, or to have

GEODESIC%UBVM.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU

   This list is for the discussion of Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller, his works 
   and his philosophies on Life, the Universe, and Everything (NOT The Douglas
   Adams book!).  For those of you who don't know, Bucky is the person who 
   invented the Geodesic Dome, which is what we all played on as children in 
   the playground (the domes with all the triangles, remember?).  Another 
   example of geodesic architecture is the giant white sphere at Disney 
   World's "Epcot Center".  Of course, Bucky did a LOT more than just invent 
   the Geodesic Dome! He invented other means of housing people cheaply, 
   efficiently, COMFORTABLY, and basically anywhere in the world! (Yes, even 
   ON the oceans!) So if you're interested in discussing Bucky, learning more 
   about him, or finding out about 8500 ft. high pyramidal cities that float 
   in the ocean and house 1,000,000 people comfortably (2000 sq ft. apartments
   with 1000 sq ft. extra patio/garden space), or 1+ mile diameter spherical 
   cities that FLOAT IN THE AIR *WITHOUT POWER*, then sign up on the list!

   To sign up, send a mail message to LISTSERV%UBVM.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU with
   the line
      SUBSCRIBE GEODESIC Your Real Name
   as the body of the letter.

HUMAN-NETS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Mailing list originally consisting of the combined memberships of 
   INFO-PCNET, HOME-SAT, and TELETEXT mailing lists.  Human-Nets has discussed
   many topics, all of them related in some way to the theme of a world-wide 
   computer and telecommunications network usually called WorldNet.  The 
   topics have ranged very widely, from something like tutorials, to state of 
   the art discussions, to rampant speculation about technology and its 
   impact.  The list is extremely large, making it necessary to batch messages
   sent to the list and distributing them once each day during off peak 
   periods to avoid overloading the system.

   The permanent archives contain all of the material distributed to the list.
   Due to size, this archive is broken down into several different files, 
   stored in reverse temporal order.  The files are currently stored on 
   ARPANet host RU-BLUE in files RHYTHM:<PLEASANT.HUMAN-NETS>HUMNET.* (where 
   "*" is a wild-card).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

ICECNET#@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

   ICEC, the InterUniversity Consortium for Educational Computing, is a 
   consortium of universities and colleges committed to developing 
   high-quality educational applications for advanced computing environments. 
   ICECNET has been the newsletter of ICEC for several years.  Paper 
   publication continues, but a copy of each issue of the newsletter will also
   be released about once a month via this mailing list.

   ICEC has supported software development at member schools and conducted 
   activities for faculty from member schools (e.g. developers' conference, 
   training programs in courseware development for advanced workstations).  
   Other mechanisms are evolving to promote development of good educational 
   programs for advanced, graphics-intensive workstations and to aid in 
   sharing these developments among interested parties.

   ICEC is therefore initiating an internet mailing list (1) for publication 
   of information about ICEC, (2) communication among member schools related 
   to internal business, and (3) as a forum for discussing issues related to 
   the general objectives of ICEC.  Examples of the third category might be 
   "what constitutes high-quality courseware?", "what Unix workstations are 
   best suited to general educational use?", "what mechanisms are best for 
   sharing educational developments using advanced technologies?", etc., etc.,
   etc.  Individuals, both from member schools and from non-member 
   organizations, are invited to contribute in this third area.

   All submissions for the monthly (paper) newsletter should be sent to:
      Patricia Clark,ICECNET editor <pc1n@TE.CC.CMU.EDU>
   or
      Robert Cavalier, assistant director of ICEC <rc2z#@ANDREW.CMU.EDU>

INFO-1100@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU

   This discussion list focuses on the Xerox/Envos Lisp environment and the 
   associated protocols.  Its purpose is to stimulate communication and 
   sharing between computer science research groups that use or are interested
   in the environment.  The list may be used for messages such as 
   announcements of available lispusers packages or for queries such as "Does 
   anybody know of a PUP file server implementation for the Sinclair ZX-80?" 
   or to warn others of Interlisp-D and Medley bugs and/or suggest workarounds
   or to solicit help or discussion.

   Xerox PARC, SIS, and Envos people are included in the distribution to 
   facilitate communication about new developments, bugs, performance issues, 
   etc..  Additionally, Info-1100 is automatically forwarded to 
   AISupport.pasa@Xerox.com, where bugs are noted and acted upon if 
   appropriate.  Xerox AIS and Envos employees will not respond in Info-1100 
   unless the reply is of general interest or silence would mislead the 
   readership.  This mailing list is also distributed as the usenet newsgroup 
   comp.sys.xerox.

   A historical note describing the name:  The Lisp environment was originally
   implemented on Xerox' 1100-series workstations, and the user base is 
   primarily still on 1108's, 1109's, and 1186's.

Info-Andrew@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

   An informal mailing list intended for general discussion by recipients of 
   the Andrew distribution (and implementors of Andrew).  Andrew, a joint 
   project of Carnegie Mellon University & IBM, is a prototype computing 
   environment for academic and research use under the UNIX operating system. 
   There are four main parts to Andrew:

      - The Andrew File System (AFS), a large-scale distributed central
        file system.
      - The Andrew Toolkit (ATK), a toolkit for building complex graphical
        user interface programs in a window-manager independent way
        (currently runs on X11 and the old Andrew window manager)
      - The Andrew Message System (AMS), a multi-media mail and bulletin
        board system compatible with non-multi-media systems
      - The Andrew application programs, a suite of programs that use the
        ATK to provide various useful features.

   Topics can include (but are not limited to):

      - hints about using/building Andrew
      - discussions about desired features, changes, etc.
      - comments about the Andrew distribution (e.g., "it stinks", "it's
        great")
      - questions about the availability/existence of other parts of Andrew

   The mailing list is available in both Andrew multi-media format (if you 
   have the AMS up and running) and plain-text format.  By default you will be
   sent plain-text versions of the posts, but you can request a change in 
   which version you receive by sending mail to the -Request address.  When 
   sending a message to this list, you should feel free to include any 
   multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.) which might help to express 
   you question, comment, etc.  Such images will automatically be stripped out
   and replaced by "A picture appeared here" before being redistributed to the
   plain-text recipients.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Andrew-Request@ANDREW.CMU.EDU.  NOTE: All 
   subscription requests will also be added to the Info-Andrew-Bugs 
   distribution list unless specifically requested not to.

   Coordinator: Adam Stoller <ghoti+@ANDREW.CMU.EDU>

Info-Andrew-Bugs@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

   Mailing list for reporting bugs/problems with the Andrew distribution.  
   (See Info-Andrew entry for more detailed description on what "Andrew" is). 
   Official responses to queries and bug reports will be posted to this 
   mailing list.  Topics include:

      - problems discovered in building the distribution
      - problems discovered in running parts of the distribution
      - questions about difficulties encountered (even if you're not sure
        they're bugs)

   When sending a message to this list, you should feel free to include any 
   multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.), that might help to clarify 
   a bug report.  Such images will automatically be stripped out and replaced 
   by "A picture appeared here" before being redistributed to the plain-text 
   recipients.

   The list will be moderated, so that all bugs can be tracked and referenced 
   with patch files.  We expect that posts will go out to the subscribers 
   about once a week, summarizing those reports which have been fixed and 
   those still being looked into.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Andrew-Bugs-Request@ANDREW.CMU.EDU.  NOTE: All
   subscription requests will also be added to the Info-Andrew distribution 
   list unless specifically requested not to.

INFO-ATARI <INFO-ATARI8@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU>
           <INFO-ATARI16@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU>

   Discussions of 8- and 16-bit Atari computers and related topics.  
   Commercial messages and advertisements are not permitted.

   Archives are kept in several places in formats available to everyone; all 
   digests are in the archives, and there is a separate program library.  As 
   described below, if you are on ARPANet/DDN you will probably find it more 
   convenient to retrieve files from the archive on RADC-SOFTVAX.ARPA using 
   FTP.  If you are not on ARPANet/DDN, or are unable to use FTP, you will be 
   able to retrieve files from archives distributed over several Bitnet hosts 
   by sending mail (notes) to a program called LISTSERV.

      Files from RADC-SOFTVAX.ARPA are available by FTP.  There are two 
      directories under the anonymous account: one for atari8 and one for 
      atari16.  FTP to radc-softvax using login:guest and password:guest.  To 
      get the current list of available atari16 files do a 'get 
      atari16/files.doc'.

      LISTSERV provides access to files for everyone who can send mail, 
      independent of their location.  On Bitnet messages should be sent to 
      your nearest LISTSERV (the one from which you receive the info-atari 
      digests); if your address is not on Bitnet, an address for file servers 
      is given below.  All mail sent to LISTSERV contains command lines.  
      LISTSERV will respond by return mail.  No subject is necessary in such 
      mail.  For more information send the command
         INFO

         The list_name for 16-bit Ataris is INFO-A16.  The list_name for 8-bit
         Ataris is INFO-A8.  These list names are used by Bitnet addressees 
         for subscribing and unsubscribing and by everyone for obtaining back 
         copies of news digests.  The list_names for programs stored in the 
         archives are PROG-A16 and PROG-A8.

         You can obtain copies of files from LISTSERV by sending a message in 
         the specified format.  To obtain a list of files in the file server, 
         the command is
            INDEX list_name
         The command to obtain a specific file is
            GET list_name file_name
         for example, GET INFO-A16 87-00076
         If you want to learn more, send the message
           HELP

         If you are on Bitnet you may add or remove yourself from the 
         distribution list.  The command to join the list is
            SUBSCRIBE list_name User_name
         The command to remove yourself from the list is
            UNSUBSCRIBE list_name

         If you are on ARPAnet (or gatewayed to it), your mail concerning 
         16-bit Atari information should be addressed to 
         LISTSERV%CANADA01.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU.  Mail concerning 8-bit 
         Atari information should be addressed to 
         LISTSERV%TCSVM.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU.

   Administrative messages should be sent to 
   info-atari8-request@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU or 
   info-atari16-request@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU.

   Discussion of DSEE, a software engineering environment from Apollo in 
   wide-spread use by tens of thousands of programmers, on projects up to 
   5,000,000 lines of code.

   DSEE elegantly and efficiently solves many common problems -- how to work 
   on multiple versions of a program at a time, how to tell when someone has 
   made a change you need to know about, how to develop software for multiple 
   target machines, how to KNOW the right version of each source file was 
   used, etc.

   If all this sounds like hype, join the mailing list, and listen to users.

   At least initially, the list will not be moderated or digested; if the 
   volume is sufficient, this may change.  Mail to the list will be archived 
   in some public place that will be announced at a later date.

info-frame%loki.pmel.edsg.hac.com@HAC2ARPA.HAC.COM

   Mailing list for System Frameworks.  This group is designed to provide 
   information for software tool developers that are responsible for 
   integrating heterogenous software products.  This can include in-house and 
   vendor supplied.  Usually, the integration of the products is designed to 
   provide an environment that makes using the tools easier.  The basic issue 
   is to build a `framework' around the tools that provides a common and 
   consistent view of the system.  The framework is not limited to homogeneous
   environments, but also can span heterogeneous systems.  Companies like EDA 
   and government sponsored projects like EIS are trying to tackle this 
   problem.  This group can be viewed as a forum for users and developers to 
   voice their opinions on this subject.  Frameworks are common in the area of
   CAD/CAE, CASE and office automation; but they are not limited to only these
   areas.  Topics open for discussion are:

INFO-FUTURES@ENCORE.COM
...{bu-cs,decvax,necntc,talcott}!encore!info-futures (UUCP)

   Digest to provide a speculative forum for analyzing current and likely 
   events in technology as they will affect our near future in computing and 
   related areas.  In broad terms, topics of interest include developments in 
   both computing research and industry which are likely to affect our 
   decision making, particularly decisions we are probably grappling with 
   right this minute.  Technologies can change so rapidly that simply 
   forecasting for needs within any organization one or two years in advance 
   can be extremely difficult, frequently we are forced to provide foundations
   that effectively lock us into a technology for longer periods of time. It 
   is hoped the information this list provides can help both the practitioner 
   and researcher determine where best to expend resources.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to INFO-FUTURES-REQUEST@ENCORE.COM.

INFO-HAMS@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   A mailing list for Amateur Radio (not CB) operators.  INFO-HAMS is 
   gatewayed to/from Usenet's rec.ham-radio so Usenet people will get it 
   there.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in HAMS-ARCHIV.TXT.
    The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.HAMS>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP for those with TCP/IP access 
   to the Internet.

   Phil Howard KA9WGN <PHIL%UIUCVMD.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU> also archives the 
   INFO-HAMS mailing list on BITNET node UIUCVMD using the LISTSERV mailing 
   list server (subscriptions disabled for this).  Users on BITNET may request
   files to be sent to them by sending commands, either by interactive message
   or in the message body by mail, to the address LISTSERV@UIUCVMD.  The 
   command to see the current online list of files is:
      INDEX INFOHAMS
   (Note there is no dash "-").  To obtain volume 88 issue 73, send the 
   command:
      GET INFOHAMS 88-00073
   INFO-HAMS is a digested mailing list, and each digest is available 
   separately from LISTSERV@UIUCVMD.

   All ARPANet/MilNet requests to be added to or deleted from this list, 
   problems, questions, etc., should be sent to

   yet have a measurable basis.  Other topics of discussion include 
   turntables, arms and cartridges; preamplifiers, headamps and cartridge 
   matching; speakers, amplifiers and matching; placement of speakers, and 
   room treatments.  Any comments that prevent an open exchange of ideas and 
   techniques are not encouraged.

Info-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   Info-IBMPC is a forum for technical discussion of the IBM Personal Computer
   and compatible micro-computers, providing a way for interested members of 
   the Internet community to compare notes, ask questions, and share insights 
   of a technical nature about these machines.  While it is not primarily a 
   consumer's guide to the IBM PC, the digest may also be useful for that 
   purpose.

   Messages are collected, edited into digests and distributed as the volume 
   of mail dictates (generally twice a week).  All messages of a technical 
   nature about IBM PCs are welcomed; messages about other topics will not be 
   run.  In addition, two topics are taboo and are routinely edited out: (1) 
   self promotion of products for sale, and (2) anything about copy 
   protection.

   Archives (back issues) for the Digest are not currently available prior to 
   issue 6-76 (October 1, 1987) on the ARPA/MILnet.

   A library of free software in source code form is maintained SIMTEL20.arpa 
   in directory PD1:<MSDOS>.  A list of all programs available from 
   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL is contained in <MSDOS>FILES.IDX.  A list of the 
   files in the Lending Library is contained in file 
   <MSDOS>PROGRAM-LIBRARY.LISTING.  Donations of source code are welcomed.  
   Donated programs must be truly free and public domain, with no fee or 
   contribution required or requested, and no license agreement.  To donate a 
   program to the library, send a description of the program along with a copy
   of the source code to INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST.

   Archives and the program library are available via a BBS; there are 
   currently two phone lines on the DLX BBS.   Files can be downloaded with 
   xmodem or un-error-checked ascii.  Modem lines are 300, 1200, and 2400 
   baud.  INFO-IBMPC DLX Phone Numbers: (213) 827-2515 or (213) 827-2635.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   BITNET users must join the INFO-IBMPC distribution list through the BITNET 
   LISTSERV mechanism.  There are BitNet sub-distribution lists 
   (IBMPC-L@CANADA01, IBMPC-L@CEARN, IBMPC-L@DEARN, IBMPC-L@EB0UB011, 
   IBMPC-L@FINHUTC, IBMPC-L@TAMVM1, IBMPC-L@UBVM, IBMPC-L@UGA, 
   IBMPC-L@UIUCVMD); BitNet subscribers can join by sending the SUB command to
   the nearest LISTSERV node.  For example:
      SEND LISTSERV@CEARN SUB IBMPC-L Jon Doe
   To be removed from the list substitute the keyword "SIGNOFF" for "SUB".
   To make contributions to the list, BitNet subscribers should send mail to 
   the ARPANet list name, NOT to the BITNET list name.

   On BITNET, the archives can be obtained from DATABASE@BITNIC.BITNET and the
   program library can be obtained from CCUC@UMCVMB.BITNET.  The 
   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL FTP server may also be reached via

INFO-KERMIT@WATSUN.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU

   Kermit is a file transfer protocol developed at Columbia University in New 
   York City, USA, for use primarily between micros and mainframes over 
   asynchronous serial connections, dialed or direct, over public data 
   networks, etc.  Kermit programs that implement this protocol can transfer 
   textual as well as binary files over both 7-bit and 8-bit communication 
   links, singly or in groups.  As of this writing (May 1989), Kermit programs
   are available for nearly 350 different computers and operating systems.  
   The Info-Kermit mailing list is a digest intended for people who maintain 
   or install Kermit at their sites, or who are (thinking about) working on a 
   new implementation, or who have bugs and/or fixes to report, or who are 
   interested in discussing the protocol, and also for Kermit users.  The 
   digest is available on Internet, CSNET, MAILNET, BITNET, EARN, USENET, 
   CCNET, DEC EASYNET, and any other network gatewayed to the Internet.

   Info-Kermit archives are collected in kermit/e/imail.*, one file (paginaged
   and indexed) per volume, generally 2 volumes per year.  Other Kermit files 
   are also available via both Internet and BitNet/EARN and by mail order.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Kermit-Request@CUNIXC.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU or to

INFO-M2%UCF1VM.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   A discussion list for the Modula-2 programming language.  Modula-2 is a 
   language by Niklaus Wirth which extends the Pascal foundation by providing 
   an updated statement syntax (generalized LOOP, EXIT, RETURN, no GOTO), 
   separate compilation with a module (compilation unit) broken into 
   specification and implementation parts with importing and exporting of 
   objects, controlled machine level access, and concurrent programming and 
   coroutines.  Modula-2 has most of the power of Ada but is small enough that
   excellent full implementations exist for CP/M 80.

   Contributions may be sent to INFO-M2@ucf1vm.Bitnet (from the US) or to 
   INFO-M2@db0tui11.Bitnet (from Europe); these are both entry points for the

   language Pascal.  Discussions of any Pascal implementation (from mainframe 
   to micro) are welcome.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   PASCAL-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.PASCAL>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to INFO-PASCAL-REQUEST@BRL.ARPA.

Info-PCNet@AI.AI.MIT.EDU

   This list was started in the 1970's to discuss and begin implementing a 
   network of personal computers to extend the advantages of net-mail to the 
   large community of personal computer users.  A nearly complete 
   specification for the protocol layers and all protocols needed for mail and
   file transferm has been written.  A few partial implementations have been 
   done and one complete one.  Recently the list has not been very active, 
   although some discussion does occur.

   The archive of old messages is kept on AI.AI.MIT.EDU, in the file
      PCNET;INFPCN ARCHIV
   There is also extensive documentation and partial code which has been 
   migrated to backup tapes.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

INFO-TMODEM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
BUG-TMODEM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   The INFO-TMODEM list is a means for the maintainer of the TMODEM program to
   send notices to users of TMODEM.  Users of TMODEM send bug reports and 
   feature requests to BUG-TMODEM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   TMODEM is a new TOPS-20 implementation of the Christensen Protocol, with 
   all the latest features, such as:
      o  wildcard file transfers in the style of MODEM7
         (YMODEM batch is coming)
      o  the YMODEM implementation of the K option with a new algorithm
         to return to K mode after falling back to "normal" mode
      o  extensive built-in HELP for all commands and options.
   TMODEM is an amalgamation of the old TOPS-20 MODEM program, originally 
   written by Bill Westfield while he was at SRI and now at Stanford, major 
   pieces of the TOPS-20 TELNET program, currently maintained by Mark Crispin,
   and some pieces of code stolen from TTLINK and KERMIT-20 by Frank da Cruz 
   at Columbia University.

   The archives for replaced mailing list INFO-MODEMXX are frozen on host 
   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files named yymm.n-TXT, where n 
   starts with one and increments by one into another file as each file 
   reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, all the mail files in the 
   archive, except for the current year, are individually compressed.  The 
   compressed files have the suffix -Z as part of the filetype field; they 
   should be renamed to have the suffix .Z (uppercase Z) when transfered to a 
   Unix system so the uncompress program will find them.  The current month's 
   mail is still kept in MODEMXX-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in 
   directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

iPSC <ipsclist@TCGOULD.TN.CORNELL.EDU>

   Mailing list to allow iPSC/1 and iPSC/2 users and systems administrators 
   from different installations to communicate easily and directly.

   Local aliases for this mailing list are to be handled by the local systems 
   administrators, since most sites already have local user mailing lists.  
   What is desired to accomplish is to link all these iPSC user lists 
   together.  The first thing needed is an administrator list and the user 
   list will hopefully follow.  If you are a system administrator for Intel 
   Hypercube(s) you are invited to send the following information to  
   ipsclist@TCGOULD.TN.CORNELL.EDU:

      - systems, iPSC/1's or iPSC/2's
      - administrator's e-mail address OR alias
      - institution
      - user alias list (might want this separate from existing
                         user list, a good idea)
      - suggestions, opinions, ideas....

   The only real boundaries to the discussion are defined by the topics of 
   other mailing lists.  Please do not send communications to both this list 
   and AIList or the Prolog list, except in special cases.  The Moderator 
   tries not to overlap much with NL-KR, except when both lists receive 
   materials from contributors or from some bulletin board or researchers.

   There is no objection to distributing material that is destined for 
   conference proceedings or any other publication.  The Coordinator is 
   involved in SIGIR Forum and, unless submittors request otherwise, may 
   include submissions in whole or in part in future paper versions of the 
   FORUM.  Indeed, this is one form of solicitation for FORUM contributions!  
   Both IRList and the FORUM are unrefereed, and opinions are always those of

   international organizations (ISO, CCITT, ECMA).  These implementations are 
   hosted on top of TCP/IP using the method discussed in RFC983.  Appropriate 
   topics are:

      - Questions about how to use ISODE (and announcements of ports to other
        target environments)
      - Discussion of ISODE as a part of a TCP/IP to ISO migration strategy
      - Exchange of ideas regarding ISO-based applications running in a native
        TCP/IP environment
      - Debate regarding where ISODE should go next

LIST OF MAILING LISTS

   Mailing-list for "List of lists" update notices.

   There is a master list of Internet mailing-lists/digests/discussion groups 
   (250+ lists/5200+ lines/243,000+ characters) on host SRI-NIC.ARPA in files:
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT  (the whole list)
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-1.TXT  (first 20% of the list)
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-2.TXT  (second 20% of the list)
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-3.TXT  (third 20% of the list)
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-4.TXT  (fourth 20% of the list)
      NETINFO:INTEREST-GROUPS-5.TXT  (last 20% of the list)
   For ARPANet users, SRI-NIC supports ANONYMOUS login within FTP, using any 
   password.  For those users without direct FTP access, the list may be 
   retrieved by sending a message to SERVICE@SRI-NIC.ARPA with
      NETINFO INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT
   in the Subject: line; the SERVICE netmail file-server will break the single
   large file into sections small enough to send back to you by netmail.

   To keep people up to date on the large number of such lists, there is a 
   mailing-list for list-of-lists \update notices/.  Copies of the list itself
   are not sent to the world at large, but for those ARPANet users who 
   seriously intend to copy the updated versions when updated, a brief notice 
   will be sent when a new version is available.  For those liaisons at 
   internet sites who maintain or redistribute copies for their own networks 
   (DECNet, Xerox, BitNet, MailNet, etc.) and can't reach the master by 
   ARPANet FTP, the complete new file will be sent if necessary.  File copies 
   will not normally be sent to individual users, either ARPANet or internet.

   To get on the list (or to submit updates to existing mailing-lists or add 
   new ones), send requests to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>

   stand-alone (with UUCP support)); for information on getting an MH 
   distribution, contact Bug-MH@ICS.UCI.EDU.  Appropriate topics are:

      - questions on how to configure MH
      - tips on MH configuration
      - exchange of MH bug reports (and fixes)

   As a general rule, messages submitted to MH-Workers should *NOT* be 
   submitted to MH-Users (a list with a different charter).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, along with problems,
   questions and suggestions, should be sent to

MHSnews%vax.runit.unit.uninett@tor.nta.no 
MHSnews@vax.runit.unit.uninett  (from the EAN R&D MHS Network)

   This conference/mailing list is open to anyone who is seriously interested 
   in implementing the CCITT X.400 (MHS) message handling protocols.  The 
   conference/mailing list can discuss such things as how to understand and 
   interpret the MHS recommendations, how to map existing mail systems and 
   mail network features onto the MHS structure etc.

   MHS gateway discussions can be found in IFIP-GTWY@TIS.LLNL.GOV.

   To minimize international communications costs, distribution lists are 
   being maintained in Europe and North America.  European users should 
   contribute messages to MHSnews@vax.runit.unit.uninett or 
   MHSnews%vax.runit.unit.uninett@tor.nta.no and North American users should 
   send messages to MHSNEWS@TIS.LLNL.GOV.  Messages sent to either list will 
   be forwarded to subscribers to the other lists.

   BITNET and NORTHNET subscribers will be served by a LISTSERV facility at 
   BYU in the USA.  EARN subscribers can be served from BYU, but we would 
   prefer EARN to be served by some site in Europe, if it can be arranged.

   USENET "subscribers" will be served by a Moderated feed to USENET with 
   "inet" distribution.  "Followup" contributions from USENET subscribers will
   be fed by the moderator into MHSnews@TIS.LLNL.GOV.

   To subscribe to the conference:
      European users:
         Send a message to MHSnews-request@vax.runit.unit.uninett
         or to MHSnews-request%vax.runit.unit.uninett@tor.nta.no
      North American users:
         Send a message to MHSnews-request@TIS.LLNL.GOV

MLA-L%IUBVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mail distribution service for the Music Library Association; this is being 
   done on a trial basis.  It is intended that the list be used for various 
   activities of MLA that can benefit by wide-scale distribution (such as 
   announcements of deadlines for NOTES and the Newsletter, news items, 
   general inquiries about MLA activities, etc.).  The list could also be used
   for reference inquiries and other topics of interest to the music library 
   community.

   The list will initially be limited to mail distribution.  No archives will 
   be maintained and no file/document server capability will be utilized 
   (these additional features may be considered at a later time).

   BitNet users can subscribe in several ways:
      For IBM (VM/CMS) systems
         TELL LISTSERV AT IUBVM SUBSCRIBE MLA-L <your name>
      For VAX (VMS) systems
         SEND LISTSERV@IUBVM SUBSCRIBE <your name
      Send a mail message to LISTSERV at IUBVM which consists of one line (in 
   the BODY or TEXT of the message):
         SUBSCRIBE MLA-L <your name>
   Non-BitNet users can also subscribe by sending the above message to 
   LISTSERV%IUBVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

music-research%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSS.CS.UCL.AC.UK

   The Music-Research electronic mail redistribution list was established 
   after a suggestion made at a meeting in Oxford in July 1986, to provide an 
   effective and fast means of bringing together musicologists, music 
   analysts, computer scientists, and others working on applications of 
   computers in music research.  Initially, the list was established for 
   people whose chief interests concern computers and their applications to

      - music representation systems
      - information retrieval systems for musical scores
      - music printing
      - music analysis
      - musicology and ethnomusicology
      - tertiary music education
      - databases of musical information

   The following areas are NOT the principal concern of this list, although 
   overlapping subjects may well be interesting:

      - primary and secondary education
      - sound generation techniques
      - composition

   This group is gatewayed to the USENET group "comp.music", but postings to 
   comp.music are not included in the digest.

   On-line archives are not yet available, but copies will be mailed on 
   request by Brad Rubenstein <bradr@INGRES.BERKELEY.EDU>.

NAC@VM1.NODAK.EDU
NAC@NDSUVM1.BITNET

   The "NAC" list is a BITNET/NetNorth/EARN Redistribution list for Usenet 
   Newsgroup news.announce.conferences. "news.announce.conferences" is used to
   post calls for papers and conference announcements.  Contributions should 
   be submitted to mcmi!news-announce-conferences@uunet.uu.net,  
   news-announce-conferences@mcmi.uucp, NAC@VM1.NODAK.EDU.,or 
   NAC@NDSUVM1.BITNET (the list is MODERATED.  Submissions to NAC@NDSUVM1 
   (NAC@VM1.NODAK.EDU) will be forwarded to the Moderator).

   Contributions sent to the list are automatically archived.  You can obtain 
   a list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX NAC" command to 
   LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 or LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU.  These files can then be 
   retrieved by means of a "GET NAC filetype" command, or using the database 
   search facilities of LISTSERV.  Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for more 
   information on the latter.  The command may be in the BODY or TEXT of the 
   mail, NOT the subject, or may be sent interactively via TELL or SEND on 
   BitNet/EARN/NetNorth.

   You may also obtain copies of the list notebooks via anonymous FTP to 
   VM1.NODAK.EDU (192.33.18.30), userid ANONYMOUS, any password.  Once 
   validated do a CD LISTARCH and DIR NAC.* to see the notebooks available.  
   The file system is NOT hierarchical so you must do a CD ANONYMOUS if you 
   want to return to the "root".

   You may subscribe to NAC by sending the command:
      SUB NAC Your_full_name      (eg. SUB NAC Jane Doe)
   to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 or LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

NAMEDROPPERS@SRI-NIC.ARPA

   The NAMEDROPPERS mailing list is to be used for discussion of the concepts,
   principles, design, and implementation of the domain style names.  The main
   focus of this group is the review of documents describing domain style 
   names.  This is a list for participants in a discussion, not observers.  
   Everyone on the list is expected to contribute from time to time.

   Nearly everyone in NAMEDROPPERS is also on HEADER-PEOPLE and also on 
   MSGGROUP.  There is no need to send a message to both NAMEDROPPERS and 
   either of these lists (and certianly not both!).

   All of the previous NAMEDROPPERS discussion can be found in SRI-NIC files
      <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.198X
   where X is the number of the year of the archive you are looking for.  A/O 
   Jan 85, there are archives for 1983, 1984 and 1985.  
   <NAMSER>NAMEDROPPERS.MAIL still contains the most current NAMEDROPPERS 
   dialog.  These files can be accessed via anonymous FTP; new members may 
   wish to copy and read these archives before joining the discussion.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to NAMEDROPPERS-REQUEST@SRI-NIC.ARPA.

NetMonth

   NetMonth is a network service publication distributed free of charge to 
   students and professionals in BITNET and other networks.  This magazine and
   it's companion file, BITNET SERVERS, are the work of the Yale Computer 
   Center BITNET Services Library (BITLIB) staff.  The BITLIB is a local 
   online help facility designed to inform Yale network users about what 
   services are available to them through BITNET, and provide instructions and
   utilities for their proper use.  In publishing NetMonth the BITLIB staff 
   members hope to share the fruits of their labor with institutions outside 
   of Yale in order to promote a productive and enjoyable networking 
   environment for everyone.  The BITLIB system is now distributed to more 
   than thirty educational institutions worldwide.

   BITNET SERVERS is BITNET's most complete and up-to-date list of servers and
   services.  It is sent to NetMonth subscribers at the same time as the 
   magazine.

   Subscribing to NetMonth and BITNET SERVERS:

   VM users in BITNET may add themselves to the mailing list with this 
   command:
      TELL LISTSERV AT MARIST SUBSCRIBE NETMONTH Your_full_name
   VAX/VMS users in BITNET can subscribe in a similar way:
      SEND LISTSERV@MARIST SUBSCRIBE NETMONTH Your_full_name
   If you cannot send messages in this way, you can send the following command
   as the first line of a mail file to LISTSERV@MARIST:
      SUBSCRIBE NETMONTH Your_full_name

   Arpanet users may use this method, but must address the mail to:
      LISTSERV%MARIST.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   A subscriber can delete him/herself from the mailing list by sending 
   LISTSERV@MARIST the command
      UNSUBSCRIBE NETMONTH.

NEW-LIST@VM1.NODAK.EDU
NEW-LIST@NDSUVM1.BITNET

   The "NEW-LIST" list has been established as a central address to post 
   announcements of new public mailing lists.  In addition, "NEW-LIST" might 
   be used as a final verification before establishing a list (to check for 
   existing lists on the same topic, etc.).  However, be sure to check sources
   such as the Internet List-of-Lists (SIGLIST or INTEREST-GROUPS list), 
   LISTSERV GROUPS, Usenet News newusers lists, and the LISTS database on the 
   major LISTSERVs (we have the LISTS database on NDSUVM1).

   It is not our intent to replace the various lists of lists that are 
   available.  We want to provide a clearinghouse to feed list announcements 
   to all those maintaining the lists and others who are interested.

   You may subscribe to the NEW-LIST list by sending RFC822 Mail to 
   LISTSERV@VM1.NoDak.EDU on Internet or LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 on BitNet.  In the 
   BODY (text) of your mail include the command:
      SUB NEW-LIST firstname lastname
   eg.  sub new-list Jane Doe
   The LISTSERV server will take your address from the "From:" address of your
   mail.  If you are on BITNET/EARN/NetNorth and can send interactive messages
   (eg.  TELL on CMS or SEND on VMS with JNET) then you can send the SUB 
   command as shown to LISTSERV at NDSUVM1 interactively.

   If you prefer, you may send mail to the Coordinator to be asked to be added
   to the list.  However you subscribe, you should receive return mail with a 
   confirmation and additional information.

NeWS-makers@BRILLIG.UMD.EDU
...!mimsy!NeWS-makers (uucp)

   Mailing list for the discussion of NeWS: the Network/extensible Window 
   System.  NeWS, originally called SunDew, was written primarily by James 
   Gosling, at Sun Microsystems, who is well known for his Unix Emacs.   NeWS 
   is an extensible multitasking window system environment, consisting of a 
   network based display server that is controlled and programmed in 
   PostScript, Adobe's page description language.  NeWS was designed to be a 
   portable, device independent window system development platform that runs 
   on a wide range of hardware, in a distributed heterogeneous environment.

   The archives are available via anonymous FTP from BRILLIG.UMD.EDU, in the 
   file "news-makers.archive".

   contacts among staff in this field.

   To subscribe to the list send the following command to LISTSERV@BUACCA 
   (non-BitNet users send mail to LISTSERV%BUACCA.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU with 
   the command in the message body):
      SUBSCRIBE NEWSB-L Your_Full_Name - School_Name
   where Your_Full_Name and School_Name are your real name and your school's 
   real name, not your userid and sitename.
   On a VAX/VMS system running JNET, this would be of the form:
      $ SEND LISTSERV@BUACCA SUBSCRIBE NEWSB-L "Any User - School"

   To unsubscribe from the list, send:

NL-KR@CS.ROCHESTER.EDU

   NL-KR is open to discussion of any topic related to the natural language 
   (both understanding and generation) and knowledge representation, both as 
   subfields of AI.  The Moderator's interests are primarily in:

      Knowledge Representation    Natural Language Understanding
      Discourse Understanding     Philosophy of Language
      Plan Recognition            Computational Linguistics

   Contributions are also welcome on topics such as:

      Cognitive Psychology (as related to NL/KR)
      Human Perception (same)
      Linguistics
      Machine Translation
      Computer and Information Science (as may be used to implement various
      Logic Programming (same)                                   NL systems)

   Contributions may be anything from tutorials to speculation. In particular,
   the following are sought:

      Abstracts                             Reviews
      Lab Descriptions                      Research Overviews
      Work Planned or in Progress           Half-Baked Ideas
      Conference Announcements              Conference Reports
      Bibliographies                        History of NL/KR
      Puzzles and Unsolved Problems         Anecdotes, Jokes, and Poems
      Queries and Requests                  Address Changes (Bindings)

   This list is in some sense a spin-off of the AIList, and as such, a certain
   amount of overlap is expected.  The primary concentration of this list 
   should be NL and KR, that is, natural language (be it understanding, 
   generation, recognition, parsing, semantics, pragmatics, etc.) and how we 
   should represent knowledge (aquisition, access, completeness, etc. are all 
   valid issues).  Topics deemed to be outside the general scope of this list 
   will be forwarded to AIList (or other more appropriate list) or rejected.  
   Readers are warned not to submit any information that is export-controlled 
   or classified.

   Archival copies of all digests will be kept and are available via Anonymous
   FTP from ROCHESTER.ARPA/CS.ROCHESTER.EDU (cd to nl-kr); feel free to ask 
   nl-kr-request for recent back issues if you have no FTP capability.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to NL-KR-REQUEST@CS.ROCHESTER.EDU.

NORTHSTAR-USERS@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   Discussion group for Northstar microcomputer users.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   NORTHSTAR-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

POLI-SCI@RUTGERS.EDU

   POLI-SCI is a spinoff from the HUMAN-NETS discussion list.  Shortly after 
   the November 1980 election, HUMAN-NETS began to discuss the impact that 
   electronic communications had on the election.  As this discussion 
   continued, it lost its narrow focus on electronic communications and began 
   to consider the election in general, how elections are won and lost, and 
   the nature of the electoral college.  The growth of these discussions, and 
   their spawning of related discussions, indicated that a separate discussion
   list was merited and POLI-SCI was installed.  Since then POLI-SCI has begun
   to consider other topics including the history of the Carter and Nixon 
   presidencies, the Iranian hostage crisis, etc. (with a little less dignity,
   the list might be characterized as a permanent distributed political bull 
   session).

   Archived digest messages are stored on RUTGERS in:

      and other files in the <poli-sci> directory

POPULATION-BIOLOGY <biosci%NET.BIO.NET@VM1.NODAK.EDU>

   Population Biology is a synthesis of population ecology and population 
   genetics, pursuing a unified theory to explain the structure, functioning 
   and evolution of populations of living beings.  Such populations are very 
   complex systems, exhibiting a variety of phenomena that we stil do not 
   master.  Just to quote a famous example, multiannual density cycles (e.g. 
   in lemmings) have not received a satisfactory expalnation, despite of 
   decades of debated studies and speculations.  Population Biology is a very 
   active field, encompassing such diverse approaches as tenacious, harsh 
   field work to track long term demographic and genetic fluctuations, or 
   sophisticated conversations with a computer about strange attractors 
   possibly causing chaos in the density fluctuations.

   Topics that can be discussed include: ecology, population genetics, 
   systematics, evolution, morphometry, interspecific competition, 
   sociobiology, mathematical modelling, population regulation, pest control, 
   speciation, chromosomal evolution, social behaviour, statistical 
   methodology in population study, population management of endangered 
   species, applications of molecular biology techniques, etc., and, last but 
   not least, your own topic.  There is no restriction on the species: 
   viruses, protokaryotes, plants, animals (including man), mythic or extinct 
   species, computer- simulated species...  Technical problems, book reviews, 
   meeting annoucements and so on are also welcome.

PROLOG[-HACKERS]@SUSHI.STANFORD.EDU

   Prolog and logic programming mailing lists.

   Some of the people answering the initial BBoard message stated that they 
   would be interested in general Prolog and logic programming information, 
   but not in the nitty-gritty details of Prolog systems and their bugs. 
   Therefore, two mailing lists have been set up, PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS: 
   PROLOG will provide a digest of articles of general interest; 
   PROLOG-HACKERS will provide a direct mailing for the nasty stuff.  Finally,
   PROLOG-REQUEST should be used for distribution requests.  In a nutshell:

      Mail to                            for
      -------                            ---

      PROLOG@SUSHI.STANFORD.EDU          sending articles of general interest 
      PROLOG-HACKERS@SUSHI.STANFORD.EDU  sending articles of limited interest 
      PROLOG-REQUEST@SUSHI.STANFORD.EDU  getting in and out of the mailing
                                         lists and other bureaucracy

   Please do not send the same message to PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS.  Messages
   will be moved between lists if appropriate.

PSYCHNET (tm)  <EPSYNET%UHUPVM1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU>

   Psychnet is a weekly electronic Newsletter and Server Machine, distributed 
   free of charge to all who request it.  It contains news about psychology, 
   letters from readers, and the latest list of files (the Psychnet Index) 
   that is available from the Server Machine.  Files available on the Server 
   Machine vary regularly, and cover a wide range of topics, including 
   preprints of papers, convention announcements, special news announcements, 
   position openings, and just about anything else related to psychology.

   There are two ways to get files from the Server Machine.  Users within 
   Bitnet who can send interactive commands (like the TELL or SEND/REMOTE 
   command) should send the command PSYCHNET HELP to userid UH-INFO at node 
   UHUPVM1.  An automatic reply (if the 'links' are up) will then guide you in
   viewing the latest Index and retrieving files.  If you cannot send 
   interactive commands (this includes all non-Bitnet users) or if you have 
   problems, request the file you want with mail to userid EPSYNET at node 
   UHUPVM1 (NOT userid UH-INFO).  Remember, you will automatically get an 
   Index once weekly in your Newsletter subscription.  A special purpose of 
   Psychnet will be distribution of selected papers in advance of the 1987 
   convention of the American Psychological Association.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from the mailing list, or to have 
   files distributed, should be sent to the Coordinator.

SF-CONS LIST

   Mailing-List for SF Conventions listing update notices.

   There is a master SF cons list (averaging 1000-1500 lines or 55,000-75,000 
   characters, including geographic cross-reference) on SRI-NIC in file:
      <ZELLICH>CONS.TXT
   For ARPANET users, SRI-NIC supports the net-standard ANONYMOUS login within
   FTP, with any password.

   In order to proliferate the list more quickly, there is a mailing list for 
   cons-list \update notices/.  Copies of the cons list itself are not sent to
   the world at large, but for those ARPANET users who seriously intend to FTP
   the updated versions every few weeks, a brief notice will be sent when a 
   new version is available.  For those liaisons at internet sites who 
   maintain or redistribute copies for their own networks (DECNet, Xerox, 
   BitNet, MailNet, etc.), the complete new file will be sent out if 
   necessary.  File copies will \not/ be sent to individual users, either 
   ARPANET or internet.

   Update notices/file copies can be expected approximately every 2nd or 3rd 
   month.  Sources of cons for the list are LOCUS, ANALOG, STARLOG, flyers 
   picked up at cons by local fen, and anything sent to the list maintainer.

   To get on the update-notices list (or to submit con updates), send messages
   to Rich Zellich <ZELLICH@SRI-NIC.ARPA>.

SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS.EDU

   Science Fiction lovers.  SF-LOVERS has discussed many topics, all of them 
   related in some way to the theme of science fiction or fantasy.  The topics
   have ranged very widely from rewritten stories, bad SF movies, and SF 
   conventions to reviews of books, movies and television shows.  The range of
   topics is quite wide and anyone is welcome to submit material on these or 
   other topics of interest in this general area.

   The archives are kept on host ELBERETH.RUTGERS.EDU, a Unix machine running 
   BSD 4.3.  You may log in using the ANONYMOUS login of FTP.  Once you have 
   logged in, connect to pub/sfl and the files are in that directory.  Because
   of space restrictions, everything may not remain online.  Below is a list 
   of the files that are currently (1 May 88) in the archives:

      Episode Guides:

   The number that appears to the left of the file is the size of that file in
   kilobytes.   All of the back issues except for volume 1 are in BABYL mail 
   format.  The first volume, sf-lovers.v1, includes a number of messages from
   the early days before digests and there is much of "historical" interest.

   The current volume is Volume 13.  Old issues of this volume may be found in
   the same directory as the archives.  They are in the files sf-lovers.xxxyy 
   where "xxx" is the month of publication and "yy" is the current year.  For 
   more recent back issues, send your request to
   SF-LOVERS-REQUEST@RUTGERS.EDU.

   Warning:  People who are on the BITNET side of the network cannot get 
   access to the archives.  The Moderator has been attempting to find a site 
   on the bitnet that is willing to house the large amounts of data, but no 
   site is willing.  Recent back issues can still be obtained through the 
   listserv mechanism at TCSVM.

   For Internet subscribers, all requests to be added to or deleted from this 
   list should be sent to SF-LOVERS-REQUEST@RUTGERS.EDU.
   BITNET subscribers may issue the command:
      TELL LISTSERV at RUTVM1 SUBSCRIBE SFLOVERS your_full_name
   or
      TELL LISTSERV at RUTVM1 UNSUBSCRIBE SFLOVERS
   where your_full_name is your real name (not your net address).
   Problems and administrative questions should always be sent to 
   SF-LOVERS-REQUEST@RUTGERS.EDU.  Submissions for the digest are to be sent 
   to SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS.EDU only.

SWAPS-L%TECMTYVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   New foreign debt restructuring in indebted countries such as Mexico, 
   Argentina, Brazil, Philipines, etc. is changing its philosophy.  Different 
   instruments have been proposed, ranging from debt-to-equity swaps, to exit 
   bonds, etc.  The topic has been discussed and some countries, such as 
   Mexico, have been negotiating new conditions and criticizing debt-to-equity
   swaps.  This discussion list will include opinions and proposals from 
   members of the group.  The list is unmoderated, but subscriptions requests 
   will be forwarded to the list Coordinator.  Weekly logs and a REView of the
   list will only be available to list members.  Professors, students and 
   professionals in Economics and related fields are welcome to join.

   To subscribe, send the following command to LISTSERV@TECMTYVM via mail or

   particularly interested in the addition and expansion of TCP services. In 
   addition to this function, it is hoped that this distribution list can aid 
   in the following areas:

      To act as an on-line exchange among TCP developers and maintainers.

      To announce new and expanded services in a timely manner.

   Archives are kept on SRI-NIC in files:
      TS:<TCP-IP>TCP-IP.*
      where the "*" is a wild-card character.

UNIX-SW@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   UNIX-SW is a vehicle for announcing the availablity of new major packages 
   of UNIX/'C' language software on the WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL repository.  
   This list will also be used to mail periodic updates of the list of all 
   UNIX software held at WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (probably monthly).

   UNIX-SW is not a forum for discussion of this software.  Such discussions 
   are more appropriately held with the authors, or in other groups.  Rather, 
   we are attempting to make known to the widest possible audience the 
   contents of this large repository of public-domain software.

   SIMTEL20 is a DEC-20 machine running the TOPS20 operating system, located 
   at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.  The machine is a host on the 
   Defense Data Network (DDN), and as such, gives users located on other hosts
   the capability of directly transferring this software via the FTP (file 
   transfer process) command.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   UNIX-SW-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   The repository has recently (Feb. '88) been completely reorganized by the 
   new coordinator.  The software is now stored in the directory PD2:<UNIX-C> 
   (it used to be stored in PD2:<UNIX>; this directory no longer exists).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to UNIX-SW-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

      (INFO-UNIX messages are also included in these files)
   Other UNIX-WIZARDS.yymmdd archives exist (although offline) going back to 
   June of 1983.  Online files may be retrieved from SRI-NIC with user

   who prefer digest format lists should periodically read the public back 
   logs of submissions, available from the LEHIIBM1 LISTSERV via a GET command
   (e.g., GET VIRUS-L LOG8806A for the first week of activity during June, 
   1988).  Mail sent to to Virus-L@LEHIIBM1.BITNET will automatically be 
   redistributed to everyone on the mailing list.  By default, you will NOT 
   receive a copy of your own letters.  If you wish to, send mail to the 
   LISTSERV saying
      SET VIRUS-L REPRO

   Archives are available, as is a file called DIRTY DOZEN which lists a 
   number of viruses, trojan horses, and pirated programs for the IBM PC.  All
   submissions to VIRUS-L are stored in weekly log files which can be 
   downloaded by any user on (or off) the mailing list.  There is also a small
   archive of some of the public anti-virus programs which are currently 
   available.  This archive, too, can be accessed by any user.  All of this is
   handled automatically by the LISTSERV.

   To find out what files are available on the LISTSERV, send mail to 
   LISTSERV%LEHIIBM1.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU saying
      INDEX VIRUS-L
   Note that filenames/extensions are separated by a space, and not by a 
   period.  Once you've decided which file(s) you want, send mail to LISTSERV 
   saying
      GET filename filetype
   For example, GET VIRUS-L LOG8804 would get the file called VIRUS-L LOG8804 
   (which happens to be the monthly log of all messages sent to VIRUS-L during
   April, 1988).  Note that, starting June 6, 1988, the logs are weekly.  The 
   new file format is VIRUS-L LOGyymmx where yy is the year (88, 89, etc.), mm
   is the month, and x is the week (A, B, etc.).  Readers who prefer digest 
   format lists should read the weekly logs and sign off of the list itself.

   To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1 (non-BitNet 
   users send mail to LISTSERV%LEHIIBM1.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU with the command
   in the message body):
