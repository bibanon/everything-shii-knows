   Mailing list for whoever may attach a meaning to the date of 9.11.1989 (or 
   89-11-09, or 11/9/89).  Unfortunately the people living in the German 
   Democratic Republic will not be able to participate in this discussion, 
   because they are not (yet?) on this network.  The list name reflects the 
   most important event in the recent German history, but it can't and 
   shouldn't be seen isolated from what happened, and is now happening, in 
   Poland, the USSR, and Hungary before.  And yes, dear Joe Techno, all this 
   will influence even such important things as our networks.

   To subscribe, send a message to LISTSERV@DBOTUI11 (BitNet) or 
   LISTSERV%DBOTUI11.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU (Internet) with the following 
   command in the body (text) of the message:

ADA-SW@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   A mailing list for those who in accessing and contributing software to the 
   Ada Repository on SIMTEL20; it serves two purposes: to provide an 
   information exchange medium between the repository users and to mail 
   repository submissions to the Coordinator for inclusion in the archives.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   ADA-SW-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   The Ada Repository is divided into several subdirectories.  These 
   directories are organized by topic, and their names and a brief overview of
   their topics are contained in file PD:<ADA.GENERAL>DIRLIST.DOC.

   problems that might be encountered, or to let everyone know about new 
   things such as new file servers, so that everyone can put the network to 
   the best possible use.

   Alternate paths/addresses: The list is served by 5 servers 
   (ADVISE-L@UTORONTO, ADVISE-L@CANADA01, ADVISE-L@NCSUVM, ADVISE-L@UGA, and 
   MD4F@CMUCCVMA) which are peer linked so that anything sent to one will be

   closest server to the CUNYVM ARPANet gateway.

   To subscribe to the list:

      From a VM site on BITNET do:
         TELL LISTSERV at CANADA01 SUBSCRIBE ADVISE-L Your_Full_Name
      where Your_Full_Name is your real name (not your userid).

      From a VMS BITNET site use the SEND/REMOTE command.

      If you are at a site not on bitnet or where you cannot send interactive 
      messages you can send a message to

AI-MEDICINE@VUSE.VANDERBILT.EDU

   ai-medicine is an unmoderated mailing list serving internet and
   bitnet domains since Sept. 1990. Current readership consists
   mainly of computer scientists and engineers with interest in
   biomedical and clinical research, and of physicians with interest
   in medical informatics.

   AI in Medicine is a broad subject area which encompasses almost
   all research areas in artificial intelligence. For the purposes
   of this mailing list, AI in Medicine may be defined as
   "computed-based medical decision support" (or "computer-assisted
   medical decision making"). This definition may be expanded
   to include AI-based approaches to computer-assisted medical
   instruction. According to this definition, topics such as billing
   systems and hospital/medical office information retrieval systems
   clearly remain outside the scope of this forum.

   There are some borderline topics which cannot readily be classified
   under AI in Medicine, yet have clear connections to both artificial
   intelligence and medical practice. Processing and interpretation of
   medical images and signals are among those subject areas, and the
   current readership of this list contains a substantial number of
   researchers working in these fields. These borderline subject areas
   will remain within the scope of the list, as long as the focus lies
   on the artificial intelligence aspects, and not the detailed
   engineering principles.

   Who may join: any individual or organization with internet or bitnet
   mailing addresses may join.

   Requests for subscription may be sent to:
                ai-medicine-request@vuse.vanderbilt.edu

   treatments, especially those available now.  It collects information from 
   medical journals, and from interviews with scientists, physicians and other
   health practitioners, and persons with AIDS or ARC; it does not recommend 
   particular therapies, but seeks to increase the options available.  The 
   ethical and public-policy issues around AIDS treatment research will also 
   be examined.  AIDS Treatment News, Northern Lights Alternatives, and many 
   other publications are also distributed to this list.

   expansion of musical ideas, techniques, and understanding.  Therefore, all 
   topics having to do with music are welcome, including but not limited to: 
   composition, performance, recording; research, critique, inquiry, advocacy,
   instrument design, ethnomusicology, psychacoustics, orchestration, jazz, 
   classical, funk, plainchant, and anything else you can think of.  If a 
   topic is running that you have something to say about, or to question, jump
   in.  If you have something entirely different in mind, start up another 
   thread.  Music is universal.  With the advent of electronic communication, 
   so are we.

ANSAXNET <U47C2@WVNVM.WVNET.EDU>

   ANSAXNET is a SIG (Special Interest Group) for scholars of the culture and 
   history of England before 1100 C.E.   Scholars interested in the later 
   English Middle Ages and those interested in the early Medieval period 
   throughout Europe are also encouraged to join the list.  Members receive a 
   directory of all our members in order to facilitate telecommunications, and
   a monthly electronic report to which they are encouraged to contribute 
   announcements and information.  This report often provides members with new
   information about the use of computers in some aspect of their disciplines,
   as well as news of more conventional developments in the field.  We also 
   have projects underway to encode databases which members may use in their 
   own work.  To this end, we are now working on the details of distributing 
   to the membership a database of all manuscripts written or owned in England
   before 1100.  We would be glad to add your name to our directory and thus 
   to make you a member of ANSAXNET.  Membership is free to everyone with 
   access to a BITNET node.

   Anyone who wants to be a member of ANSAXNET should send e-mail to the 
   Coordinator, including a conventional mailing address and some information 
   about your particular interests in early medieval cultural studies.

ARACHNET@acadvm1.uottawa.CA
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]
   A Loose Association of Electronic Discussion Groups and Electronic
   Journals of Interest to Scholars.

   There are more than 600 discussion groups, newsletters, digests and
   electronic journals devoted to topics of scholarly interest.  As more
   scholars come on-line, the size of these groups, the diversity of
   material they have to offer, and their total number are all bound to
   increase.  These groups could benefit from a loose confederation that
   would allow them to share resources easily without imposing any kind
   of restrictions on their manner of operation.  Arachnet is such a
   confederation.

   Arachnet is a ListServ list, Arachnet@Uottawa.BITNET or ARACHNET@ACADVM1.
   Uottawa.CA if you are on the Internet.  All editors of
   discussion groups, newsletters, digests and electronic journals are
   invited to be members.  On its file-server, Arachnet will contain a
   current list of its member groups, descriptions of each group, and
   lists of files they hold.  As well as the current Directory of E-mail
   Based Conferences and Electronic Journals.  Arachnet's fileserver
   will also hold various information files pertaining to the creation
   of e-serials.

   The conversational component will be a means by which editors of new
   groups can receive help from their colleagues on questions of
   editorial policy and the social/ethical aspects of electronic
   conferencing.  Arachnet is not intended to replace Lstown-L@INDYCMS
   which is a discussion list for listowners to discuss technical
   aspects of Listserv based discussion group management.

   Arachnet will be an unedited list but will accept postings only from
   Arachnet subscribers.  If you are an editor or owner of an existing
   or future e-mail based forum, you are cordially invited to join.

   Please fill out the attached e-form and return it to one of the
   Editors listed below.  Please follow the format below as closely as
   possible.

ARPANET-BBOARDS@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
ARPANET-BBOARDS@LCS.MIT.EDU

   Redistribution address for all known BBoards on the ARPANET.  The 
   guidelines for postings are somewhat loose.  The ostensible purpose of the 
   list is to distribute: (a) emergency notices ("Southern California just 
   slid into the Pacific, machines at ISI and UCSD will be down for a few 
   days"), and (b) notices of "academic interest", such as seminar and 
   symposium announcements.  Advertisements and for-profit notices are not 
   appropriate (the DoD would get upset, among other considerations).  A 
   touchy borderline case is job offerings.  The practice has been to accept 
   postings from universities (the research community) and the research 
   oriented military installations (the people paying for our hardware) but to
   refuse postings from private companies.  The (shaky) rationale behind this 
   is that university and military job offerings are "research opportunities" 
   as opposed to for-profit advertisements (ie, joining the army or a 
   university is not the way to get rich).

   Anyone is welcome to redistribute Arpanet-BBoards; it takes some of the 
   (considerable) load off of MC's mailer.  But please don't do it without 
   sending a message to the -Request address first.

   There are Archive copies of every message ever sent to the list but no 
   guarantee is made that they will be online or available at any particular 
   time.  The current archive file, such as it is, can be found as 
   "COMAIL;BBOARD ARCHIV" on MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to the Coordinators.  Bitnet users may subscribe to 
   the list by doing:
      TELL LISTSERV at RUTVM1 SUBSCRIBE ARPABBS Your_Full_Name
   where Your_Full_Name is your real name (not your userid).  From a VMS 
   BITNET site use the SEND/REMOTE command.

ARTNET@UK.AC.NEWCASTLE
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   The list is for anyone who has or who may have an interest in
   network;  installation;  project;  communication;  temporary;
   ad-hoc;  transient;  mobile;  time-based;  formless;  de-centred art.
   Potential members include artists, art-administrators, writers,
   theorists, students, teachers.  The aim of the list is to encourage
   contributions from all who have dipped a toe into these waters and
   found them congenial, but who know not where to turn next.  The idea
   is that alliances will be formed, projects launched, funding gained,
   technology utilised, ideas launched and wild speculation indulged in.
   I hope that art projects will be instigated via this list.  It is
   within my desire for the list that it evolves.

   The list encompasses:

   *Projects               *New work               *Events

   ARTNET provides a forum for the discussion of ART that is concerned
   with: network;  installation;  project;  communication;  temporary;
   ad-hoc;  transient;  mobile;  time-based;  formless;  de- centred.  I
   call this PERIPATETIC art.

   I define peripatetic art thus:
   The art or action of creative endeavour with lack of fixed base.
   There is no fixed centre which claims to have 'the knowledge'.  All
   projects involve some aspect of lack of enclosure;  the promotion of
   action without centre.  Peripatetic art tends towards the transient,
   the time based, the mobile.  Peripatetology is as much about
   receiving the action, the project, as it is about initiating it.

   I am concerned with improving communication amongst those working in
   these and related areas.  By its nature this kind of work often does
   not lend itself to easy documentation or definition.

   The concept mooted here, and encapsulated in the term 'peripatetic',
   has by its very nature a changeable agenda.  I hope that in action we
   will create new ways of working alongside some very old human
   desires.

ART-SUPPORT@NEWCASTLE.AC.UK
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   Art-Support exists as a forum for the discussion of ART related
   matters.  Potential members include artists, art-administrators,
   writers, theorists, students, teachers and others with an interest in
   art.

   This list provides a general magazine type information exchange and
   discussion area.  As in any specialist magazine there will be much of
   interest to subscribers and also some irrelevance.

   Although not in any way subscription/geographically limited, the
   focus of the list is intended to be the UK art community.  It is
   hoped that the list will stimulate the use of network resources.  The
   idea is that alliances will be formed;  projects launched;  funding
   gained;  technology utilised;  ideas launched and wild speculation
   indulged in.

   ART-SUPPORT is about ART, not technology.  Any art or art related
   subject is acceptable.

   The list encompasses:

   *Projects               *New work               *Events
   *Collaborations         *Funding                *Technology
   *Shows                  *Jobs                   *Conferences
   *Proposals              *Organisations          *Information
   *Publications           *Education              *Wild speculation

      We are inviting all users to assist in the coding of projects.  For 
      instance, our first task will be a Resident Program Manager.  We will 
      use Turbo Assembler or MacroAssembler to develop the applications.

      A second project will be an AV package to viruses, we already have 
      programs for Jerusalem and Brain, these could be help for it.

   The users of this list will receive mail with code contributions and 
   discussions, and eventually the program source listing finished with the 
   help of the participants.  Then, the list will propose a new project to 
   work on.  Any and all code contributions, ideas, and anything else that 
   will help in achieving this opening goal will be appreciated, discussed, 
   reported and acknowledged for the list.

   building up people-to-people contacts and working together on matters
   of common interest. A core aim of this list is to foster practical
   projects.

   Participants living in the Baltic Republics.
   People around the world with origins in the Baltic Republics,
   or who have connections with those countries.  Anyone with
   technical skills in electronic networking who may want to contribute
   to developing electronic links to the Baltic Republics.  Anyone
   needing to research on developments in the Baltics.  Anyone around
   the world with a need to contact, visit and/or work with College staff
   or students living and working in Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia.

   Although English is likely to be the lingua franca, ALL languages of
   communication are WELCOME: but especially in Lithuanian, Latvian or
   Estonian.

   *               BELIEF-L:  Personal Ideologies Discussion List
   *
   *  This list is designed to be  a forum where personal ideologies can be
   *  discussed, examined,  and analyzed.   Topics for  the list  can range
   *  from "what  is good"  to "what  happens after death"  to "is  there a
   *  god".

   *
   *  The  list  is open  for  all  discussion pertaining  to  ideological,
   *  religious, moral,  and ethical  topics.  There  are only four general

   *       (2)   Excessively rude, obnoxious, or abusive posting will
   *             not be tolerated.

   *
   *       (4)   Due to the varied nature of computer systems, please

   BIRDEAST, BIRDCHAT, BIRDCNTR, and BIRDWESTon LISTSERV@ARIZVM1

                The National Birding Hotline Cooperative
               ==========================================

   We are pleased to announce that the National Birding Hotline
   Cooperative list on LISTSERV@ARIZVM1 has gone to a regional format.
   The three new lists, which replace the former BIRD_RBA@ARIZVM1,
   provide a clearing-house for transcribed birding hotlines for three
   major areas of the country--East, West, and Central.  The new lists
   are BIRDEAST, BIRDCNTR, and BIRDWEST.

   Current subscribers to BIRD_RBA will be automatically shifted to all
   three of the new lists.  New subscribers must choose which of the
   three regional lists best answers their needs.  Of course, new
   subscribers may still subscribe to all three lists for full coverage.

   Subscribers are invited to submit transcripts from their area of the
   country if it is not already represented.  A current list of hotlines
   available from the National Birding Hotline Cooperative is appended.

   Contributions to the lists are always welcome and should be sent in
   MAIL format to BIRDEAST, or BIRDWEST, or BIRDCNTR, all at ARIZVM1.
   Please note that these are not intended to be general chat lists.
   Contributions should either be transcripts of birding hotlines or, if
   a local hotline recording is not available to you, concise statements
   of species seen and the location of the sighting, along with any
   relevant information such as 'out of range,' 'out of normal time
   frame,' etc.  If you are confused about which of the three lists to
   send your material to, contact either of the list owners first.
   Their Bitnet/Internet addresses are listed below.

   You may subscribe to The National Birding Hotline Cooperative by
   sending an interactive SUBSCRIBE command or by including a SUBSCRIBE
   command as the ONLY line of a MAIL message to LISTSERV@ARIZVM1, as
   follows:


     Interactive example from CMS:

          TELL LISTSERV AT ARIZVM1 SUB BIRDEAST <Your full name>
                              or       BIRDCNTR
                              or       BIRDWEST


     MAIL example:

          SUB BIRDEAST <Your full name>
          or  BIRDCNTR
          or  BIRDWEST

   To cancel your subscription, issue the SIGNOFF command to
   LISTSERV@ARIZVM1:

          SIGNOFF BIRDEAST
            or    BIRDCNTR
            or    BIRDWEST

   Do NOT send SIGNOFF or other LISTSERV commands to BIRDEAST, BIRDCNTR,
   or BIRDWEST.

   If you are on the Internet network, subscription messages should be
   sent to LISTSERV@ARIZVM1.BITNET and hotline transcripts should be
   mailed to BIRDEAST@ARIZVM1.BITNET (or CNTR or WEST, as the case may
   be).  In some cases, Internet mailer programs will not know how to
   get to a local Internet/Bitnet gateway.  If this appears to be a
   problem for you, send subscription messages to:

          LISTSERV%ARIZVM1.BITNET@CORNELLC.CIT.CORNELL.EDU

   and hotline transcripts to:

          BIRDEAST%ARIZVM1.BITNET@CORNELLC.CIT.CORNELL.EDU
      or  BIRDCNTR
      or  BIRDWEST

   The following states are currently represented with transcribed
   hotlines on the three regional lists:


           BIRDEAST            BIRDCNTR            BIRDWEST
           ========            ========            ========
           Maine               Ohio                New Mexico
           New Jersey          Indiana             Arizona

       Bibliographic Instruction

     BI-L is a computer conference dedicated to discussing ways
   of assisting library users in effectively and efficiently
   exploiting the resources available in and through the libraries
   of the 1990s.

     Contributors to the forum deal with the practical,
   theoretical, and technical aspects of what has been called
   Bibliographic Instruction, Library Use Instruction, Library
   Orientation, and several other names.  We examine, explore,
   critique, appraise, and evaluate strategies, programs, and
   equipment that we have found to be valuable (or not) in working
   toward the goal of the self-sufficient library user.

    To join BI-L, send the following e-mail message to
     LISTSERV@BINGVMB: SUBSCRIBE BI-L Your Name.  (Put your first
     and last name where it says "Your Name.")

    To contribute to BI-L, send your e-mail message to

BIO-NAUT%IRLEARN.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU
BIO-NAUT on LISTSERV@IRLEARN.BITNET

   A mailing list for BIONAUTS has been established at IRLEARN
   The main purpose of the list is to facilitate communications
   between life scientists. This list will have three main functions.

   1) It can be used to ask questions about networking addresses
      of scientists in the biological life sciences.
      e.g. I need to get in contact with some one at EMBL
           who should I send mail to.

       **** SOMEONE OUT THERE KNOWS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ***

   2) If you have small databases of E-mail addresses related to your
      particular field of interest they can be uploaded onto BIO-NAUT
      for the benefit of others. Special interst groups welcome.
      e.g. Numerical taxonomists, Culture Collections, etc.

       ****  INSTANT HIGH PROFILE FOR YOUR GROUP  ****

   3) If you subscribe you will be asked to send ONE MESSAGE to
      BIO-NAUT which gives a brief outline of who you are and your
      main interests. Instructions on the format of this MESSAGE
      will be sent to all subscribers individually.

      **** ADD YOUR NAME TO WHO'S WHO OF BIOLOGICAL NETWORKING ****

   To subscribe to the BIOSCI Bionauts distribution service
   at IRLEARN, send the following command as one line in the body
   of a mail message to, LISTSERV@IRLEARN.BITNET
                         ========
   saying just

   SUBSCRIBE BIO-NAUT forename surname

   Those of you who are directly on EARN or BITNET can also subscribe
   with an interactive message, e.g.

     TELL LISTSERV AT IRLEARN SUB BIO-NAUT forename surname
     (on an IBM running VM/CMS)
   or
     SEND LISTSERV@IRLEARN SUB BIO-NAUT forename surname
     (on a VAX running VMS)

   When you have done that, you will get an acknowledgement that  you
   now belong to the distribution list. Once subscribed, you can send
   mail messages to

     BIO-NAUT@IRLEARN.BITNET

   and they will be AUTOMATICALLY redistributed to all the other
   subscribers. They (and you) can then reply to that address and
   everyone will see the answers.

    Remember

     The SUB command for subscribing goes to LISTSERV@IRLEARN.BITNET
     (LISTSERV%IRLEARN.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU for Internet users)     
     Your mail messages for others to see go to BIO-NAUT@IRLEARN.BITNET

      BIO-SOFTWARE                 BIO-SOFT            bionet.software

   The BIO-SOFTWARE newsgroup is not moderated.  Questions, answers, and 
   discussions are welcomed about software related to the biological sciences 
   (or even about problems with other software that scientists might use in 
   the course of their work such as word processors or communications 
   software).

   To subscribe to this newsgroup, please send your subscription request to 
   one of the following addresses; if you previously received e-mail from any 
   of the three superceded groups, then you should have been subscribed to 
   BIO-SOFTWARE.  If you have any questions or doubts about this, please

   and other Societies of Biomechanics, and for others with an interest in the
   general field of biomechanics and human or animal movement science.  For 
   the scope of this list, see, e.g., the Journal of Biomechanics (Pergamon 
   Press), the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering (ASME), and Human Movement
   Science (North-Holland).

   To subscribe to BIOMCH-L, send the following command to

BIOMED-L%NDSUVM1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list for discussion on the topic of Biomedical Ethics.  Since the 
   field of medicine and medical technology are rapidly changing and the field
   is so broad, it is difficult to have clearly delineated rules as to what 
   should and should not be discussed, but possible topics might include:
      Paternalism             Fetal Cell Transplant
      The Right to Die        AIDS
      Suicide                 Patient Autonomy
      Abortion                Drug Legalization
      Euthanasia              Respirator Withdrawal
      Transplants             Allocation of scarce resources
   and many others too numerous to list here.  The discussions may be ethical,
   philosophical, religious, political, social or even, in some cases, 
   personal.  Open discussion, disagreement, and dissent is encouraged.  Open 
   flames are most certainly *not*.

   To subscribe to BIOMED-L send the following command to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1:
      SUBSCRIBE BIOMED-L your_full_name
   where your_full_name is your real name, not your userid.  Non-BitNet users 
   can subscribe by sending the above command in the text/body of a message to
   LISTSERV%NDSUVM1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

   Coordinator: Bill Sklar <86730%LAWRENCE.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU>

BIOSPH-L%UBVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   This list replaces the now defunct list OZONE@ICNUCEVM.  The new name 
   reflects better the topics discussed.  Anything relating to the biosphere, 
   pollution, CO-2 effect, ecology, habitats, climate, etc., can be discussed.
    Basically anything that exerts an influence of some kind or another on the
   BioSphere.

   New archives will be stored in a monthly notebook.  Archives from the old 
   Ozone List will eventually be transferred to the BIOSPH-L site.  Even 
   though there is no longer a connection to the owners of the old list, the 
   idea is to continue on from the topics that were being discussed up to when
   it went dead.

   To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@UBVM.BITNET:
      SUBSCRIBE BIOSPH-L Your_full_name
   To leave or signoff the list send:
      SIGNOFF BIOSPH-L
   Non-BitNet users can [un]subscribe by sending the commands in the body text
   of a message to LISTSERV%UBVMS.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

BISEXU-L@BROWNVM.BROWN.EDU
BISEXU-L@BROWNVM.BITNET

   Mailing list for discussion of issues of bisexuality.  Cordial and 
   civilized exchange of relevant ideas, opinions and experiences between 
   members of all orientations is encouraged - we do not discriminate on the 
   basis of orientation, religion, gender, race, etc.

   This list is not intended in the spirit of separatism from any other lists 
   devoted to lesbian, gay and bisexual issues but as an additional resource 
   for discussion of bisexual concerns in particular;  by the same token, the 
   existence of Bisexu-L should not imply in any way that other discussion 
   lists are no longer appropriate forums for discussion of bisexuality.

   The list of subscribers is confidential for purposes of personal privacy; 
   excessively rude, obnoxious or abusive postings will not be tolerated.

   BitNet users can subscribe by sending the following command to 
   LISTSERV@BROWVM:
      SUBSCRIBE BISEXU-L your_full_name
   where "your_full_name" is your real name, not your login Id.
   Internet users can subscribe by sending the above command in the text/body

      TELL LISTSERV AT BITNIC SUBSCRIBE BITNEWS Your_Full_Name
   where Your_Full_Name is your real name (not your userid); from a VMS BITNET
   site use the SEND/REMOTE command.  If you are at a site not on BitNet or 
   where you cannot send interactive messages, you can send a message to 
   LISTSERV%BITNIC.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU, where the first non-header line 
   consists of:
      SUBSCRIBE BITNEWS Your_Full_Name

   Please note that there is no BITNEWS-REQUEST address.  Questions, problems,
   etc., should be referred to the Editors.

BUDDHA-L on LISTSERV@ULKYVM.LOUISVILLE.EDU
         or LISTSERV@ULKYVM.BITNET
	[Last Updated 28-January-1992]
 
   An electronic discussion group called BUDDHA-L has recently been
   formed towards the end of providing a means for those interested in
   Buddhist Studies to exchange information and views.  It is hoped that
   the group will function as an open forum for scholarly discussion of
   topics relating to the history, literature and languages, fine arts,
   philosophy, and institutions of all forms of Buddhism.  It may also
   serve as a forum for discussion of issues connected to the teaching
   of Buddhist studies at the university level, and as a place for
   posting notices of employment opportunities.
 
   The primary purpose of this list is to provide a forum for serious
   academic discussion.  It is open to all persons inside and outside
   the academic context who wish to engage in substantial discussion of
   topics relating to Buddhism and Buddhist studies.  BUDDHA-L is not to
   be used for proselytizing for or against Buddhism in general, any
   particular form of Buddhism, or any other religion or philosophy, nor
   is it to be used as a forum for making unsubstantiable confessions of
   personal conviction.
 
   The discussion on the list is to be moderated, not in order to
   suppress or censor controversies on any topic, but rather to limit
   irrelevant discussions and idle chatter, and to redirect or return
   messages sent to the list by accident.  Content or style will never
   be altered by the moderator, whose only responsibility will be to
   forward all appropriate postings to the list.
 
   If you wish to subscribe to BUDDHA-L, send an e-mail message to
   LISTSERV@ULKYVM.LOUISVILLE.EDU, or BITNET nodes can send to
   LISTSERV@ULKYVM.  The message should contain only the following
   command (ie. in the body of the mail):
 
      SUBSCRIBE BUDDHA-L <your first and last name>

C+Health on LISTSERV@IUBVM                  Computing and Health
            or LISTSERV@IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   C+Health is intended to promote sharing of information, experiences,
   concerns, and advice about computers and health.  Anecdotal evidence,
   media reports, and some formal studies suggest that computer users
   are at risk from misuse and overuse of computers.  Eyestrain,
   headache, carpal tunnel syndrome, and other apparently
   computer-related maladies are increasing.  And, it would appear that
   colleges, universities, and other institutions have been slow to
   respond with education, training, office and lab design, furniture
   purchasing, and other programs that could make computing more
   healthful -- and productive.

   We welcome questions and answers;  article and book reviews;
   hardware, software, and furniture evaluations;  approaches to
   influencing institutional policy;  speculation;  and humor.  Medical,
   legal, technical, financial, aesthetic, and administrative viewpoints
   are encouraged.  We hope that this forum will be of interest to end
   users, computing managers, epidemiologists, and policymakers.

   Subscribers to this list may also wish to participate in EDUCOM's
   Project EASI: Equal Access to Software for Instruction, "dedicated to
   assisting higher education in developing computer support services
   for people with disabilities." EASI provides information and guidance
   on campus applications of adaptive computer technology.  For
   information on EASI, contact Carmela Castorina,
   CSMICLC@UCLAMVS.BITNET.

   In general, C+Health will focus on individual and institutional
   measures for "keeping healthy people healthy" as well as remedies for
   restoring temporarily disabled people to health.  We suggest that
   computing issues related to those with permanent disabilities be
   referred to our dedicated colleagues at EASI.  Although this
   distinction will not always be "easy," one goal of C+Health is to
   minimize the number of casualties in our increasingly
   computer-intensive campuses, offices, and homes.

   This list will not be moderated, at least initially, so we encourage
   contributors to be succinct, to include relevant parts of messages to
   which they are responding, and to append their names, titles, and
   institutions to contributions.  New users are welcome to send to the
   list a brief statement of their experiences and interests in this
   topic.  Unless stated otherwise, it will be assumed that
   contributions represent individual opinion rather than institutional
   policy.

   To subscribe to C+Health send mail with the following command to
   LISTSERV@IUBVM (from BITNET sites) or LISTSERV@IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU
   (from Internet sites).

CCNET-L%UGA.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Chinese Computing is a discussion group on technology relating to the use 
   of Chinese on computers.  It is intended to be a forum for both experts and
   regular users and to reach wherever computer networks can reach, from North
   America to the Far East.  Although different people may have different 
   definitions for Chinese computing, at it's current stage, the technology 
   for Chinese word processing and desktop publishing software is in the 
   greatest demand.  Discussions will concentrate on this technology as 
   implemented in both software and hardware.

   The focus of the mailing list may change when other technologies become 
   more important.  There have been suggestions that Chinese programming 
   languages may be a requirement when Chinese data base software gets more 
   popular.  The postings to this group may include:
      News of new software, hardware and technology
      Product reviews
      Comments

   --- Additional Information ------------------------------------------
 
   -------------------------------------
   2.  About messages posted in Chinese.
   -------------------------------------
 
   A number of coding schemes have been developed for using Chinese on
   computers.  The two most common are GuoBiao (developed in mainland
   China) and Big5 (developed in Taiwan).  Complicating matters further,
   there are different varieties of Big5 codes, the most common being ET
   Big5 (the code used by the Taiwanese program ETen, pronounced
   Yi3tian1) and HKU Big5 (the code used for programs developed at Hong
   Kong University).
 
   There is a preference for GuoBiao (often abbreviated to GB) among
   CHPOEM-L subscribers, though files using other codes are welcome.
   Utilities are available for converting between GuoBiao and Big5, and
   between ET Big5 and HKU Big5; see below.
 
   Chinese files sent to the list should be uuencoded.  The uuencode
   command is included on most Unix-based systems; type "man uuencode"
   for instructions on its use, or ask your system administrator.  PC
   versions of uuencode and uudecode are available via anonymous ftp
   from ahkcus.org [192.55.187.25] as uuduue20.zip in the src/pc
   directory.  (Ask your system administrator for help using FTP.)  For
   information about uuencode and the Mac, see the Mac help file
   mentioned below.
 
     Note:  Sometimes you may get an error message when uudecoding
     a file, indicating some kind of "short file" problem; garbage
     may then show up at the end of the decoded file.  This is be-
     cause the mail system removes blank spaces from otherwise blank
     lines.  When you uuencode a file, the next to last line is often
     just one blank space, which then disappears when you mail the file.
     When you try to uudecode the file, uudecode detects the missing
     space and announces the "short file" error. There are two ways to
     avoid this problem:
 
       (1) Before mailing a uuencoded file, replace all spaces with
           an open-single-quote (`) mark.  (As far as uudecode is
           concerned, the ` mark and space are exactly equivalent.)
           If you receive a uuencoded file in the mail, but the sender
           neglected this step, simply type the ` mark in on the blank
           line above the "end" line, then uudecode the file.
 
       (2) Ask your system administrator to install a more recent version
           of uuencode that uses ` instead of space. Source code for this
           is available via anonymous ftp from ahkcus.org in the src/unix
           directory.
 
   To read a file written in Chinese, you will need a program that can
   interpret the Chinese code used in that file.  Different programs are
   available for different hardware platforms.
 
   PC users can get information about GuoBiao editors by sending email
   to LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the message GET PC HELP.  HKU Big5 files
   can be viewed with shownews.exe or readnews.exe, available via
   anonymous ftp at ahkcus.org [192.55.187.25] in the src/pc/hku
   directory.  (You will also need the chinese.16 font file from the
   same directory.)  ET Big5 files must be read with the ETen operating
   system, which is commercial software selling for about US$80.
   However there is a utility, et2hku, to convert ET Big5 files to HKU
   Big5 files, which can then be read with shownews.  (See below.)
 
   Mac users can get information about both GuoBiao and Big5 software by
   sending email to LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the message GET MAC HELP.
 
   X Windows users can use either cxterm or xhzview for both GuoBiao
   or Big5 files.  For information about cxterm, send email to
   LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the message GET CXTERM HELP.  For infor-
   mation about xhzview, send email to LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the
   message GET XHZVIEW HELP.
 
     Note: Users may run into problems because different systems indicate
     line endings differently.  Unix-based systems use linefeed (ASCII
     10, ^J) to end a line, the Mac uses carriage return (ASCII 13, ^M),
     and PC systems use carriage-return/linefeed.
 
     This usually can be solved by using an editor or automatically fixed
     though transferring process. If NOT, you can use the following methods:
 
       + MAC to UNIX convertion:
 
         At unix prompt type,
            tr '\015' '\012' < Mac_file > Unix_file
 
       + MSDOS to UNIX conversion:
 
         FTP folding.c from ahkcus.org:./src/unix.  Folding removes
         carriage-returns and, if desired, adds linefeeds according to a
         specified linewidth. Simply compile the source code and excute it
         for `how to use' message.
 
        [ ...... this section is not complete ]
 
   -------------------------
   3.  Conversion Utilities.
   -------------------------
 
   To convert between GuoBiao and Big5 (et or hku) files, use hc ("Hanzi
   Converter"), available via anonymous ftp from ahkcus.org [192.55.187.25]
   in the src/unix directory.  (There is another conversion utility
   available called b2g, but it seems to miss a large number of
   characters.)  Since Big5 covers about 5,000 more characters than
   GuoBiao, it's likely there will be a few missing characters in Big5
   to GuoBiao conversions.
 
   To convert between ET Big5 and HKU Big5, use et2hku, available via
   anonymous ftp from cs.purdue.edu [128.10.2.1] in the pub/ygz/utils
   directory.
 
   ----------------------------
   4.  File naming conventions.
   ----------------------------
 
   The names of files containing poems should indicate the poet and, if a
   non-GuoBiao Chinese file, the coding standard used (et, hku, etc.).
 
   Since one goal of the list is to assemble a database of Chinese poems,
   there is a preference for using one uuencoded file per poem, and to
   number a poet's poems sequentially as they are posted to the list.
   For example, the first person to post a poem by Li Bai might name the
   file libai.001 (or, if an ET Big5 file, libai.001.et).  The next
   person would call his or her file libai.002, and so forth.
 
   Of course latecomers or those with short memories will not know how
   many poems by a given poet have already been posted to the list.  In
   that case, add your name or id after the poet's name and start your
   own numbering system.  For example, if your computer id were nw1, and
   you wanted to post a Li Bai poem but didn't know the number of the
   last Li Bai poem posted, you should name yours libai_nw1.001.
 
   Indexes of poems previously sent to the list will be distributed
   periodically.
 
   If you want to post a large number of files at once (say, more than
   three or four poems), we suggest you use the tar file archiving
   program.  Unix users can get instructions for tar by typing "man tar"
   at their system prompt, or by consulting their system administrators.
   There is a PC version of tar available via anonymous ftp at
   procyon.cis.ksu.edu [129.130.10.80] in the pub/PC/UnixLike directory.
 
   Try to use as reliable a source as possible when typing poems, and
   identify it in your message.  As a general rule, try to use the
   following format:
 
     line 1:  AUTHOR TITLE     ; (Poet's name, a space, then title of poem)
     line 2:  <blank line>     ; (Leave a blank line before starting text)
     line 3:  ...text...       ; (Text of poem)
      ...        ....
 
   Add your name and/or email id at the end, if you wish.
 
   -------------------
   5.  Still confused?
   -------------------
 
   If you have any questions, can't get software working, or whatever,
   try sending mail to the list.  Someone is likely to know the answer,
   or at least offer sympathy.

   Jefferson Community College - University of Kentucky announces a new
   electronic discussion group for faculty, staff and administration at
   two-year institutions, COMMCOLL@UKCC.

   Access to COMMCOLL is available internationally thus forming a global
   network of two-year college educators who recognize the importance of
   teaching in communicating knowledge to the next generation.  The use
   of COMMCOLL is a a major breakthrough in facilitating instant
   communication among faculty, administrators, and staff at two-year
   institutions.

   Appropriate messages for COMMCOLL include: polls;
   information-gathering questions;  feedback on one's research;
   program proposals and development;  calls for papers;  meetings,
   media, and job announcements;  consultation with other faculties
   discussing problems and solutions facing campuses around the world;
   as well as any other issues pertinent to creating and enhancing
   teaching effectiveness in two-year institutions.

   While messages sent to COMMCOLL are received by all subscribers,
   users may then contact specific individuals via BITNET to pursue
   particular projects, issues, and interests.  Since computer systems
   differ, please be sure to include your userid and node at the end of
   each posting.

   To subscribe to the COMMCOLL list send e-mail to LISTSERV@UKCC
   (on BITNET) or LISTSERV@UKCC.UKY.EDU with the following

   comp-academic-freedom-news on LISTSERV@eff.org
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

           Computers and Academic Freedom Mailing Lists

   Purpose: To discuss questions such as: How should general principles
   of academic freedom (such as freedom of expression, freedom to read,
   due process, and privacy) be applied to university computers and
   networks?  How are these principles actually being applied?  How can
   the principles of academic freedom as applied to computers and
   networks be defended?

   There are three versions of the mailing list.

   comp-academic-freedom-talk
           - you'll received dozens of e-mail notes every day.
   comp-academic-freedom-batch
           - about once a day, you'll receive a compilation of the day's notes.
   comp-academic-freedom-news
           - about once a week you'll receive a compilation of the best
             notes of the week. (I play the editor for this one).

   To join a version of the list, send mail to listserv@eff.org.
   Include the line "add <name-of-version>".  (Other commands are
   "delete <name-of-version>" and "help").  NOTE: This is NOT
   the same LISTSERV that is being used on BITNET sites.

   In any case, after you join the list you can send e-mail to the list
   by addressing it to caf-talk@eff.org.

   Alternatively, if you may be able to read the mailing lists as
   newsgroups.  Look for alt.comp.acad-freedom.talk and
   alt.comp.acad-freedom.news.

   The best notes from each month are available via anonymous ftp from
   eff.org as files "pub/academic/news/July", etc.  Also, see file
   "pub/academic/README".

CONSIM-L on LISTSERV@UALTAVM (LISTSERV@VM.UCS.UALBERTA.CA)

   Conflict Simulation Games List

   CONSIM-L is a new list to provide an unmoderated environment for
   discussion of historical conflict simulation games, particularly
   the games published in Strategy and Tactics and Command magazines,
   but also including boxed games from such publishers as The Avalon
   Hill Game Company, Victory Games, and Game Designers Workshop.

   The explicit purpose of CONSIM-L is to provide a platform for
   discussion of recently published games, but discussion can range
   over the general topics of conflict simulation design, military
   history, tactics and strategy, game collecting, convention and club
   announcements, or any other topic related to conflict simulation
   games. As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the discussion and
   topics are only limited by the participation and interest of its
   subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an active role by
   posting and/or an inactive role by monitoring the list.  Although not
   necessary for participation, it shall be assumed that all subscribers
   are basically familiar with board wargames.

   To subscribe to CONSIM-L, please send mail or file to
   LISTSERV@UALTAVM or listserv@vm.ucs.ualberta.ca and place in
   the body of the text the line

   SUB CONSIM-L <your name>.

   This list does not support any archive functions.

Contents on LISTSERV@Uottawa (BITNET)
         or LISTSERV@Acadvm1.Uottawa.Ca (Internet)
 
   This list will simply announce new and recent publications of
   relevance to Religious Studies and related disciplines.  It will post
   the table of contents, prices, and when available, abstracts of both
   books and journals.  These postings will be logged in notebooks for
   searching and, in future, made available as a TELNET accessable and
   searchable database.
 
   The Wilfrid Laurier University Press is the first to make this
   information available to the CONTENTS list.  I hope to soon convince
   the AAR and SBL presses to join in asap.  The rest should come
   running soon enough.
 
   The list will not be conversational.  Frequency of postings will
   depend on the number of cooperating publishers.  If the load gets
   heavy postings will be grouped together accounding to some extremely
   esoteric classification system.  There is the possibility that down
   the road, CONTENTS will also serve to distribute reviews from
   IOUDAIOS, RELIGION and other lists, if such a service is deemed
   useful.
 
   To subscribe to CONTENTS send the following email message to
   Listserv@Uottawa     or    Listserv@Acadvm1.Uottawa.Ca
 
      SUB CONTENTS your name
 
   Contact the list coordinator, Michael Strangelove, for more

  	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

       Creative Writing Pedagogy for Teachers and Students

   This list was created as a place to discuss how and why creative
   writing is being taught at colleges and universities, including the
   role it plays in the curriculum, the history of creative writing
   programs, the shape and flavor of creative writing courses, and the
   influence it has or should have on students' lives.  Any teacher who
   has ever taught a creative writing course (poetry or fiction) and any
   student who has ever taken such a course should feel welcome to
   participate.

   The list is open and unmoderated, so discussion can range as far and
   wide as members want, from ethereal theory to classroom strategies
   and anything remotely tangential to either.  However, this list is
   not intended to be a place for sharing creative work.  Not that such
   sharing is in any way forbidden, but there are other lists designed
   for that purpose.

   To subscribe, send an interactive message or mail to LISTSERV@UMCVMB

CUMREC-L%NDSUVM1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   The list is intended for anyone involved with computer use in college and 
   university administration, especially for non-technical administrators; it 
   is named after the annual conference.  Topics include, but are not limited 
   to:

      Purchase of administrative software from vendors--advice from some 
      campuses that may not be on a vendors list of *showcases*

      General purpose software and hardware purchase--not nuts and bolts, but 
      some general sharing of ideas

      You've decided to write a major administrative system from scratch-- 
      will someone share something with you so you don't need to re-invent the
      wheel?

      The CUMREC conference itself--sharing information, keeping in touch with
      people we've met at past conferences.

      Just about anything that a CUMREC paper could be written on.

DEOS-L on LISTSERV@PSUVM.BITNET
       or LISTSERV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   The American Center for the Study of Distance Education at
   Pennsylvania State University have now decided to open DEOS-L, an
   international dis- cussion forum for distance education.

   Initially, the intention is to facilitate discussion of some of the
   issues presented in DEOSNEWS.  We hope to promote communication among
   distance educators, and to disseminate information and requests about
   distance education around the world.

   DEOS-L will be open for everyone who wants to subscribe, and all sub-
   scribers may post information to the list.  However, to enhance the
   quality of DEOS-L, we have decided to review the notes posted.

   To subscribe to DEOS-L, just post the following command to
   LISTSERV@PSUVM or LISTSERV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU:
       SUBSCRIBE DEOS-L Your Full Name

DIABETIC on LISTSERV@PCCVM

   As of today I have established a forum for the open discussion of
   diabetic concerns by the people directly involved - the diabetic
   patient.  I take this move because my wife is also a diabetic with
   advanced complications.  I feel that an open forum for those most
   affected that is free from criticism is sorely needed.

   To subscribe to this list send a message or MAIL to LISTSERV@PCCVM
   on BITNET with the content containing the command:

DOROTHYL on LISTSERV@KENTVM
         or LISTSERV@KENTVM.KENT.EDU
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   DOROTHYL is a discussion and idea list for lovers of the mystery
   genre.  It was concocted by a group of women librarians at a July
   1991 Washington, D.C.  meeting of the Association of Research
   Libraries and named in in honor of one of the great women mystery
   writers of the century.  Agatha Christie and Josephine Tey were
   strong contenders, but Dorothy L. Sayers had a LISTSERV-blessed
   middle initial.  Although there was serious discussion about limiting
   DOROTHY to women particpants and it would be entertaining to identify
   impostors (no doubt men would sneak on with anonymous ID@node, to
   join in DOROTHY's energizing discussion), the organizers opted for
   the widest possible number of serious participants.

   Tenets of DOROTHYL:

   -Everyone is welcome.
   -Those who wish to adopt the name of a mystery character, may use
    that name in postings.
   -The participants WILL have fun.

   Some suitable subjects for posting are:

   -Announcements of forthcoming books and previews.
   -Reviews, criticisms, comments, and appreciations of mysteries
    (books, plays, films).
   -Great mystery bookshops.
   -Awards.  It can take a long time to learn which are the annual
    prizewinners.  DOROTHYL may consider posting these as files.
   -Mysterious events.  Mystery travels, mystery walks in cities,
    mysteries of life.
   -Ideas for happenings, perhaps an evening of mystery readings at
    ALA or ARL or MLA?
   -An electronic mystery, with clues (apples, perhaps red ones of
    the Macintosh variety?), villains (the mailer-Daemon?), red
    herrings (byte-marks?), heroines, detectives -- the potential is
    as unlimited as the world of networking.

   At the outset, the list will be un-moderated (self-monitored).

   Everyone who joins ought to consider contacting her (his) favorite
   mystery author and inviting her (him) to join this list.  Since many
   mystery writers are academics, this could be a very fruitful and
   exciting chase.

   Subscription Instructions:

   To subscribe from a Bitnet account send an interactive or e-mail
   message addressed to Listserv@kentvm .  From the Internet send
   mail to listserv@kentvm.kent.edu .

   If you send e-mail leave the subject line blank.  The text of the

DTP-L on LISTSERV@YALEVM.BITNET  Desktop Publishing Digest

   Many users throughout internet, bitnet & elsewhere have expressed an
   interest in starting a digest to exchange information on desktop
   publishing in general, and on the subtleties and complexities of
   specific programs, including, but not limited to, Quark Xpress, Aldus
   PageMaker and FreeHand, Adobe Illustrator, Ventura Publisher,
   Framemaker, Interleaf, and Fontographer.  Please note that these
   would not be system level discussions;  they would deal more at the
   user-level.  Also, technical discussions of PostScript for its own
   sake (and not how it related to these programs) would be covered in
   the PostScript forums and digests.

   Caveats aside, every user of these and other programs has discovered
   some excellent work-arounds, irritating problems, or elegant
   solutions.  These could be shared for the benefit of all.  I have
   also set up contacts with Quark, and I'm receiving quick shipment of
   Zappers and other software to be available to list members and the
   net_community at large.  Hopefully similiar agreements can be made
   with other publishers.

   Some emphasis will be placed on use of service bureaus and medium- to
   high-resolution output devices (Linotronics, Agfas, Varitypers, etc.)
   without becoming overly technical.

   The list organizers (myself and Jeff Wasilko of RIT) also have
   conventional typesetting backgrounds, and we manage service bureaus
   at our schools.

   The list is called DTP-L. To subscribe, execute the CMS command:
      tell listserv@yalevm subscribe DTP-L firstname middleinit lastname

   Or send a mail to listserv@yalevm (or listserv@yalevm.ycc.yale.edu)
   which contains as its first & only line (substitute your name for
   firstname, etc.):

      subscribe dtp-l firstname middleinit lastname

   Because this is a digest, items of interest should NOT be sent to the
   listserver for efficiency's sake.  Send submissions to:

   glenn_fleishman@yccatsmtp.ycc.yale.edu
      or to
   jjwcmp@ultb.isc.rit.edu

   These submissions will be edited & compiled.  When collected items
   reach 30K they will be distributed through the listserver mechanism
   to all subscribers.

   If you cannot subscribe through conventional means, please contact
   Glenn Fleishman at the above address.  Put "subscription" in the
   subject field of the memo.

         TELL NEWSERV AT UNCVM1 ADD DYNSYS-L username

      At UTSO use the VMSG command send to userid NEWSERV, node UNCVM1, and a 
      message of ADD DYNSYS-L username.

      VAX/VMS sites running jnet version 2 use the ADD command like this:
         SEND NEWSERV@UNCVM1 ADD DYNSYS-L username

   BitNet users with other environments can contact their local user services 
   group for assistance.  Users without interactive messaging capability, or 
   non-BitNet users can send a request to ULTIMA@UNCVM1 
   (ULTIMA%UNC.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU) or to one of the list Coordinators to 
   have their names added to the list.

   The DROP command is used to remove a name from a list:

      For remote IBM/VM sites, the DROP command is used like this:
         TELL NEWSERV AT UNCVM1 DROP DYNSYS-L

      At UTSO use the VMSG command send to userid NEWSERV, node UNCVM1, and a 
      message of DROP DYNSYS-L.

      VAX/VMS sites with jnet version 2 can use this command:
         SEND NEWSERV@UNCVM1 DROP DYNSYS-L

E-EUROPE on LISTSERV@NCSUVM.BITNET
         or LISTSERV@NCSUVM.CC.NCSU.EDU
	[Last Update 28-January-1992]

   Eastern European Business Network (E-EUROPE)

   E-EUROPE is the new electronic communications network for doing business
   in Eastern Europe countries (including the countries of the former
   Soviet Union). Its purpose is to help these countries in their
   transition to market economies. It will link business persons in Western
   Europe-Asia-North America with those in Eastern Europe.

   E-EUROPE allows transmission of electronic mail and files worldwide (via
   Bitnet, Internet, Junet, Compuserve, MCI Mail, etc.). Subscription is
   free and open to anyone who can access a BITNET or INTERNET electronic
   address. While the E-EUROPE is located on a mainframe computer, anyone
   with a personal computer and modem may gain access.

   E-EUROPE provides information exchange via e-mail and also provides
   document/file transfers between E-EUROPE subscribers. A subscriber is
   anyone who has requested an E-EUROPE subscription by sending a message
   to the communications management software (called LISTSERV) located on
   the mainframe computer at North Carolina State University, USA. A
   subscriber also has the option of concealing their name and node address
   from public scrutiny.

   A. Present Activities of E-EUROPE

      1. E-mail
         Once a user subscribes to E-EUROPE, (s)he may send mail to the list
         for distribution to all its members. All members of the mailing
         list will receive a copy of each piece of mail sent to the list.
         All of the mail that is received and redistributed by the list is
         cataloged and stored in a database that can be searched or
         retrieved by individuals with access to E-EUROPE.

         In order to prevent "rapid-fire" random e-mail transmissions, all
         messages are relayed to the E-EUROPE editor for a once-daily
         (maximum) batch mail release. In addition, each subscriber may
         disable the automatic E-EUROPE e-mail transmission to their site
         and download logfiles of each month's traffic.

      2. E-EUROPE Filelist
         Datafiles will be available for downloading to subscribers. The
         objective is to develop a clearinghouse of information on doing
         business with Eastern European countries.

      3. Potential/Future Activities
         a) electronic business newsletter
         b) electronic user directories
         c) bibliographies of current business research
         d) seeking interested parties for business activities (exports,
            imports, or direct investment)
         e) job bank

   B. Subscription and File Downloads:
      To subscribe to E-EUROPE send E-mail to LISTSERV@NCSUVM or
      LISTSERV@NCSUVM.CC.NCSU.EDU with the body containing the command

      SUB E-EUROPE yourfirstname yourlastname

      To download a file, send E-mail to the LISTSERV using the GET
      command. E.g.
      GET filename filetype E-EUROPE

      For example,
      GET E-EUROPE INTRO E-EUROPE

      Direct any questions to the list editor:
      James W. Reese, E-EUROPE Editor
      Associate Professor of Economics
      University of South Carolina, Spartanburg
      Spartanburg, SC 29303 USA

E-HUG on LISTSERV@DARTCMS1.BITNET  Computing in Hebrew

   The new list E-HUG@DARTCMS1 provides for distribution of the
   Electronic Hebrew Users Newsletter.  The newsletter is the successor
   to the print publication, "Hebrew Users Group Newsletter" which was
   edited by Jack Love, and emanated from the Berkeley Hillel Foundation
   through 1989.

   This incarnation is electronic-only, and is mandated, like the
   original, to cover all things relating to use of Hebrew, Yiddish,
   Judesmo, and Aramaic on computers.  It is released as time permits
   and information demands, currently every 1-2 weeks.  This newsletter
   is dedicated to the proposition that computers, to be useful, must be
   usable to people working in all languages, at the convenience of
   those users.  In that spirit, we print all questions pertaining to
   use of the Hebrew alphabet on computers and answer all those that we
   can.  We encourage discussion on all levels of computer
   facility--from new users looking for software or Hebrew-related
   resources (educational, graphic, or otherwise), to discussions by
   developers on how the software should work (when it works :-)).  We
   also do our best to report on new software (or updates) of interest
   and to serve as a general news source to the field.

   The list is maintained via LISTSERV and subscription may be obtained
   by the usual mechanism of sending the command
      SUB E-HUG yourfirstname yourlastname
   to LISTSERV@DARTCMS1.

   Questions may be directed to the list owner, Ari Davidow
   <well!ari@apple.com>.  Archives may be obtained from
   LISTSERV@DARTCMS1 using the SEND command and currently consist of
   E-HUG 91-00001 to E-HUG 91-00011.

EBCBBUL%HDETUD1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   EBCBBUL is short for EBCB BULletin board, a facet of the European Bank of 
   Computer Programs in Biotechnology (EBCB).  EBCB is a non-profit making 
   organization mainly funded by the European Community (EC).  The main goal 
   of EBCB is to stimulate and facilitate the use of computers in 
   biotechnological training and research in Europe. EBCBBUL will not only 
   promote user/user communication, but will also provide users with up to 
   date information (e.g. about courses/congresses).

   Items accepted for the bulletin board will be distributed via electronic 
   mail (e-mail) to all participants and will also be retained for future 
   reference.

   EBCBBUL is public, and anyone with access to EARN can participate.  Before 
   you gain access to EBCBBUL through EARN or a related system, however, you 
   must issue one of the following commands:

      For EARN nodes operating with VM/CMS systems type the following:
         TELL LISTSERV AT HDETUD1 SUBSCRIBE EBCBBUL (followed by your name)

      For EARN nodes operating with VAX/VMS systems type the following:
         SEND LISTSERV @ HDETUD1 SUBSCRIBE EBCBBUL (followed by your name)

      On other systems send mail to LISTSERV@HDETUD1 (or 
      LISTSERV@HDETUD1.TUDELFT.NL, or for Internet users 
      LISTSERV%HDETUD1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU) with the body/text of the mail 
      containing the command:
         SUB EBCBBUL yourfirstname yourlastname

      As soon as your request for access has been accepted, you will receive, 
      by e-mail, confirmation of this fact.  Because of limitations imposed by
      e-mail (traffic volume etc.) this may take several hours.  After that 
      you will be able to search EBCBBUL using LDBASE or LSVTALK (these are 
      programmes, available within the EARN node, that make interactive 
      searching possible).

         Statistics Education Discussion List
	[Last Updated 28-January-1992]

   The purpose of this list is to provide a forum for comments,
   techniques and philosophies of teaching statistics.  The primary
   focus is that of college level statistics education, both
   undergraduate and graduate studies.

   Statistical literacy has become a social imperative if we are to
   share a responsible, thoughtful citizenry.  As people involved or
   interested in the instruction of statistics, we have a precious asset
   in our collective knowledge.

   This list exists because WE CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER:

        What techniques are we using in statistical instruction?

        What strategies should we use to prepare our students for the
                future?

        What part do/should computers play in instruction?
                (are computers a new tool or a new subject for students?)

        What assets can we share among ourselves?
                (public-domain software programs, datasets, etc.)


   There are many individuals working in these areas, each with
   knowledge valuable to the others.  This list attempts to bring
   together every teacher, student, researcher, and specialist
   interested in improving statistical instruction.

   You are encouraged to:

     * Submit summaries of or commentary on published articles and books
       which address problems or solutions in teaching statistics

     * Share the results of your experiments with teaching statistics

     * Ask thought-provoking questions about the future of statistics
       education and the environments in which it takes place.

     * Recruit interested parties to this list, regardless of
       their status in education, industry or government.

EDTECH%OHSTVMA.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   This list was conceived to bring together students, faculty, and 
   "interested others" in the field of educational technology to share ideas 
   and information.  Some topics we have in mind include:

      - A discussion of articles, books, and blurbs you've found stimulating
        and worthwhile
      - Information about course offerings and edtech graduate program
        requirements at your school
      - Notable educational hardware and software, as well as junk one should
        avoid
      - Current dissertations and research projects in edtech
      - What's been keeping you up at all hours?  Perhaps another one of us
        could help.

   A list of the archived files of previous EDTECH discusions can be received 
   by sending the command:
      INDEX EDTECH
   to LISTSERV@OHSTVMA.  You can then request a specific month's discussion by
   sending the command:
      SENDME Filename Filetype
   For example:
      TELL LISTSERV@OHSTVMA SENDME EDTECH LOG8905  (would send the May log)

   To subscribe, send the following command to LISTSERV@OHSTVMA via mail or 
   interactive message:

ELLHNIKA on LISTSERV@DHDURZ1.BITNET  Greek TeX

   Thanks to the friendly support of DANTE and especially of Joachim
   Lammarsch a discussion list on Greek TeX (cf.  "CALL FOR
   STANDARDIZATION OF GREEK TeX AND CREATION OF A GREEK TeX GROUP") has
   been opened, at

                 ELLHNIKA@DHDURZ1

   You can subscribe by sending the usual

                 SUBSCRIBE ELLHNIKA yourfirstname yourlastname

   to LISTSERV@DHDURZ1.  Please note that messages to the list should be
   send to the list adress ELLHNIKA@DHDURZ1 and not to the LISTSERV.

   Languages of the list are English and Greek (Modern please!!)
   It would be appreciated if you use Silvio Levy's transliteration
   for Greek, as long as no other transliteration has been fixed.
   If you have to use a different one, please precise the corres-
   pondences at top of the message.

   The list is intended for  linguists of any origin having to typeset
   ancient Greek, as well as for people using Greek as their everyday's
   language. It is quite a dilemma for me to encourage
     - the former to participate in English and discuss the TeXnical
       problems of ancient Greek
     - the latter to participate in Greek and in this way get used to
       the transliterated expression of the language; as I said in the
       "CALL", a certain effort must be taken to bypass the handicap of
       having a different alphabet, this list should serve as a starting
       point inside the TeX world.
   So there are two languages and two directions to take. Let's find a
   compromise based on the spirit of cooperation! (and if a scholar decides
    to learn Modern Greek for breaking this Gordian knot, I guarantee him
    that he won't be dissapointed!).

    YOU ARE INVITED TO JOIN US IN THE DISCUSSION ON GREEK TeX

ETHCSE-L@UTKVM1.UTK.EDU
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

                Ethical Issues in Software Engineering

   ETHCSE-L is an unmoderated, unarchived list which deals with ethical
   issues of interest to professional software engineers.  The list is
   intended to provide the opportunity for software engineers and those
   interested in software engineering to discuss ethical concerns of the
   discipline.  As the discipline is rapidly advancing new ethical
   issues arise in the practice of software engineering.

   The group might be expected to discuss things like the move by some
   state governments toward licensing software engineers, establishing a
   code of ethics, or articulating a set of principles which guide
   professional practice.  The list can also be used as a place to
   announce conferences, and publications and issue call for papers.

   To subscribe, send an interactive message or mail to
   LISTSERV@UTKVM1 or mail to LISTSERV@UTKVM1.UTK.EDU with
   the body containing the command

ETHICS-L%MARIST.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   Discussions of ethics in computing usually generate more heat than light.  
   This list could do a lot toward generating more light if we do more than 
   trade war stories and opinions of the "I'm right and you're NOT" variety.  
   Of course we can't get any work done without some war stories, since they 
   furnish food for thought.  But we shouldn't stop there.  Given our 
   experiences, we ought to be able to delineate the basic issues and hot 
   areas in computer ethics.  Some current ones have to do with:

      - ownership of information (both data and program files)
      - what happens when systems programs fail? Is anyone responsible for
        damage done?  Or is the responsibility only for the necessary fix?
      - responsibility for program failures (Is the company responsible?
        the programmer? the lead programmer? the project manager?) Who's
        responsible for the "fix"?
      - how much privacy is reasonable (there are all kinds of levels here;
        data bases, systems, LANs, networks, etc.)

   BitNet users can add themselves to the list by issuing the following 
   command to LISTSERV@MARIST.BITNET:
      SUBSCRIBE ETHICS-L your_full_name
   where your_full_name is your real name (not your userid).
   BitNet users can unsubscribe with the command:
      UNSUBSCRIBE ETHICS-L

   All other requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, 
   questions, etc., should be sent to the Moderators.

ETHOLOGY%FINHUTC.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   An unmoderated mailing list for the discussion of animal behaviour and

   papers, conferences, new software for behavioural analysis etc., are also 
   encouraged.

   EUEARN-L is a new list devoted to discussion of computers, computer
   communications and electronic developments in Eastern Europe.  It is
   an attempt to help the new networks in these areas with technical and
   social advice, and to foster their development.
 
   It hopes to smooth the integration of computer networks in Eastern
   Europe into the world networking system.  Eastern Europe is defined
   roughtly as that area between the Baltic and Adriatic/Mediterranean
   sees, and between the borders of Byelorussia/Ukraine and France/
   Switzerland.
 
   It is a counterpart to such lists as PLEARN (Polish computing)and
   SUEARN (Soviet).  Earn is the European Academic Research Network.
   The list is to be a mixture of technical and conversational.  The
   principal language will be English but there will be no objection to
   the use of languages native to the countries concerned.  Where
   possible, and if the messages are of general rather than individual
   interest, English summaries should be provided.
 
   The list is unmoderated for the time being.  The list manager is as
   below.  EUEARN-L is is based at University of Buffalo.  Subscriptions

   please send it to this list.  Later all the information will be compiled 
   and used in the paper.  The names of the people who submitted to the list 
   will never be used in the paper.  All the Coordinator is interested in is 
   what kind of an attack, done where, and what harm it caused.

   Also if there is anyone who thinks they can help in determining a way to 
   compile such experiences please write to the Coordinator directly.

FedTax-L@SHSU.BITNET   Federal Taxation / Accounting Discussion
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   FedTax-L is a new list supported by Sam Houston State University of
   Huntsville, Texas, to provide a generally unmoderated environment for
   the discussion of federal taxation issues from both a practical and
   academic viewpoint.  The discussions are intended to include latest
   trends, regulatory actions, and, of course, a lively exchange of
   ideas and concerns.

   The explicit purpose of FedTax-L is to provide quick and timely
   interchange between subscribers, to provide a forum where support may
   be available for interesting questions which may not be addressed
   locally (or may desire a "second opinion"), and to discuss current
   and potential taxation issues.  It is also the hope of the owner of
   the list to develop databases of at least late breaking tax matters
   for access to all subscribers.  Archives of FedTax-L postings will be
   available for reference.  As is the case on all unmoderated lists,
   the discussion and topics are only limited by the participation and
   interest of its subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an
   active role by posting to FedTax-L or an inactive role by monitoring
   the list.
	
   This group is now gatewayed to the usenet group misc.taxes.

   To subscribe to FedTax-L, please send a MAIL message to:
          LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET             ====
   The body of this MAIL message should be one line and contain the words:
   SUBSCRIBE FedTax-L

   Please note that LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET is MAIL-oriented only --
   interactive commands send to this address will not be recognized.

   Questions regarding this announcement should be addressed to the list
   owner at any of the addresses listed below.

GEODESIC%UBVM.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU

   This list is for the discussion of Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller, his works 
   and his philosophies on Life, the Universe, and Everything (NOT The Douglas
   Adams book!).  For those of you who don't know, Bucky is the person who 
   invented the Geodesic Dome, which is what we all played on as children in 
   the playground (the domes with all the triangles, remember?).  Another 
   example of geodesic architecture is the giant white sphere at Disney 
   World's "Epcot Center".  Of course, Bucky did a LOT more than just invent 
   the Geodesic Dome! He invented other means of housing people cheaply, 
   efficiently, COMFORTABLY, and basically anywhere in the world! (Yes, even 
   ON the oceans!) So if you're interested in discussing Bucky, learning more 
   about him, or finding out about 8500 ft. high pyramidal cities that float 
   in the ocean and house 1,000,000 people comfortably (2000 sq ft. apartments
   with 1000 sq ft. extra patio/garden space), or 1+ mile diameter spherical 
   cities that FLOAT IN THE AIR *WITHOUT POWER*, then sign up on the list!

GO-L%SMCVAX.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU
GO-L on MAILSERV@SMCVAX


    GO-L, a new list for game players interested in the game of GO is now
    available for public use. The list is sponsored by Saint Michael's College
    in Winooski, Vermont.  The list is intended to serve as a discussion point
    for GO-related topics, and as a meeting place for EMAIL games between
    list members.

    In contrast to the majority of BITNET lists, this one is supported by a 
    DEC uVAX 3400 running the MAILSERV program for VAX/VMS.  Consequently, 
    commands used to access the list are slightly different than those used 
    by LISTSERV. MAILSERV supports the following commands, among others:

     HELP      -  Ask for the HELP file.
     SUBSCRIBE -  Subscribe to a list.
     LISTS     -  List all mailing lists for a MAILSERVer.

     MAILSERV accepts only mail messages; not interactive SENDs or TELLs.  
     Be sure to send only a mail message with your commands in the body of 
     the message. Don't type any other text into the message; it won't work!

      As an example, to subscribe to the GO-L list, send a mail message to

      MAILSERV%SMCVAX.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

      and in the body of the message just put the command

      SUBSCRIBE GO-L

      Notice that you don't need to give a subscription name; MAILSERV gets it
      From your address.

Green on ListServ@IndyCMS (BITNET/CREN)   Green movements study list
      or ListServ@IndyCMS.IUPUI.Edu (Internet)

   Green is dedicated to the study of Green movements worldwide and
   their influence on public opinion and public policy.  The scope of
   the list's discussion is global: all Green movements, at every level,
   are of interest to this list.

   Of special interest to the list is the emerging Green movement in the
   US -- how it is being organized by various competing elements, how it
   is being influenced by other Green movements worldwide (especially
   European), how it is interacting with those movements, and how it is
   influencing American public opinion and public policy on the local,
   state, regional and national level.

   It is emphasized that the purpose of Green is the *study* of Green
   movements.  Green is *not* a tool for organizing or promoting those
   movements.  In keeping with policies defining the appropriate use of
   academic networks (which often include prohibitions on explicit
   political activism), adherence to the stated purpose of this list is
   strictly monitored and enforced.

   Green is open to all persons interested in the study of Green
   movements worldwide.  To subscribe send mail to LISTSERV@IndyCMS
   on BITNET or LISTSERV@IndyCMS.IUPUI.EDU with the body containing
      SUB GREEN yourfirstname yourlastname

grad-adv@listserv.acs.unc.edu   The Graduate School Advisors List

   This list has three major goals at the onset:
   1) to put folks who advise undergraduates about graduate school in
      touch with their peers and with graduate schools. Being on the list
      will provide this service.
   2) to create of a catalog of accessable catalogs (using Art St.
      George's Library catalog catalog as a model) to facilitate electronic
      access to graduate school information. I will gather information here
      unless there is another volunteer out there.
   3) to identify useful and/or neccessary information that would be
      used in a graduate school information database with an eye toward
      network standard tags and a single engine queriable distributed
      database of graduate school information (probably SQL for example)
      that would allow students and advisors to search several catalogs
      maintained at different universities.
   Point three is very blue sky for the moment, but if we keep it in
   mind, the  technology exists and the end is actually achievable.
   Other points will, I'm sure, arise.

   To add yourself to grad-adv, send a MAIL message of:
   subscribe grad-adv
   to listserv@listserv.acs.unc.edu

   To remove yourself from grad-adv, send a MAIL message of:
   unsubscribe grad-adv
   to listserv@listserv.acs.unc.edu

   Mail to be distributed to grad-adv should be sent to:

   The GS/DSP Discussion List serves as an unmoderated forum for
   discussion of GS/DSP co-processor board for the Apple II family of
   computers currently being developed by Pete Snowberg.  This list is
   for the discemination of information about the GS/DSP and the
   discussion of possible applications for the GS/DSP.
 
   Messages sent to this list are not reviewed by the list owner and are
   automatically forwarded to everyone on the list.  If you want to send
   private messages to each other or to Pete this is not the way to do
   it.  If you would like to send a private message to Pete Snowberg you
   can reach him at:
 
        pets@abacus.com
 
   Messages are not verified and the authors of the messages are solely
   responsible for their content.
 
   List coordinator:
   ===================
   If you want to unsubscribe, change address, contact me at the
   following address:
 
        gsdsp-request@ocf.berkeley.edu
 
   The List:
   ===========
   To post submissions to everyone on the mailing list you can send it
   to:
 
        GSDSP@OCF.Berkeley.edu
 
   When you send your message to the above address, everybody on the
   list gets it!  This is where you send your submissions to the mailing
   list.  If you want to be removed from the mailing list do not send it
   here but send it to the list coordinator address
   (gsdsp-request@ocf.berkeley.edu).
 
   One more note on this mailing list.  This list is being run out of
   the Open Computing Facility at UC Berkeley.  This is a cluster of 18
   Apollo Domain DN3500 workstations run by a completely student staff.
   This cluster is not the most stable one in the world but mail here
   generally is.  (Note: I said GENERALLY.) From time to time this
   cluster might disappear off of the net and your submission might not
   make it through.  But these occurrences should be even less frequent
   now with the addition of another network gateway.  So if your
   submission to the list bounce, try again later and the list should be
   back up.
 
   Archives:
   ============
   From time to time there will be informational postings from Pete or
   other developers about their products related to the GS/DSP, these
   messages will be archived and if you want send a message to the list
   coordinator and he will forward to you the requested file.
 
   Archive Listing:
   ====================
   This will be listing which files are availble.  Currently we only
   have two files, the GS/DSP Preliminary Press Info that was posted to
   comp.sys.apple2, this one and a long question and answer post by Pete
   Snowberg about the DSP board.

HELP-NET on LISTSERV@TEMPLEVM.Bitnet

   HELPSERV has evolved.  Helpserv and all its component files have been
   integrated (finally!) into LISTSERV at TEMPLEVM.  In addition, there
   has been the addition of a mailing list, and a NAME CHANGE.

   Introducing HELP-NET at TEMPLEVM.

   Help-Net is a discussion list for the purposes of solving user
   problems with utilities and software related to the Internet and
   Bitnet networks.  In addition, LISTSERV at TEMPLEVM maintains a set
   of low-level help files intended to help the beginning user
   acclimatize himself to the network systems.

   Both novice and experienced users are encouraged to join the
   discussion list, either to ask questions, or to answer them.
   Questions on almost any network topic are encouraged, however there
   are a few ground rules we ask that you observe.

   1. Please do not post where can I find this game, or that specific
   gif file, etc.  There are several lists that deal specifically with
   those topics.  The question, Where would I find a list that could
   tell me where to get ???  on the other hand is quite acceptable.

   2. Please do not post any messages that relate to the illegal traffic
   of copyrighted material.

   3. Feel free to redistribute the help files freely.  We do ask that
   you identify the source of any materials.

   4. We gratefully accept both topics for additional Help sheets, and
   submissions to be placed on the server.  For more information about
   submitting, get the file SUBMIT INFO from the server.  See below for
   instructions.

   Below are some brief instructions on how to access the HELP-NET list.

   1. Signing on to the list.  Send the following command to LISTSERV at
   TEMPLEVM, as either an interactive message or the body of a mail
   message:

   SUB HELP-NET (Your Name)

   2. Getting a file from the list.  Send the following command to
   LISTSERV at TEMPLEVM:

   GET HELP-NET FILELIST

   Choose which files you want and send a get command for each of those
   files.  If you have a problem, ask the list.  It's what we are here
   for.  Please note that you must be a list subscriber to access files.

   3. Posting a message on the list.  - Send your mail message to
   HELP-NET at TEMPLEVM.  Your mail will be forwarded to all list
   members, and you will be replied to.

   I thank everyone for their support and interest and hope that I and
   the HELP-NET will continue to be of service to everyone in the
   network community.  If you have any questions regarding Help-Net,
   please direct them to V4078 at TEMPLEVM.  Again, thank you for your
   support.

   Christianity.  Subscription requests should be sent to BAYS@UKANVM.
   I will attempt to act upon them as quickly as possible.  Postings
   should be made to HISTEC-L@UKANVM.  LISTSERV@UKANVM will accept both
   BITNET and INTERNET mailings.  I would appreciate subscribers'
   sending me by e-mail (at BAYS@UKANVM) a short biographical resume for
   inclusion in a members' directory.
 
   Our FTP directory is presently empty.  Subscribers who have materials
   they believe worth including should contact me by e-mail.  This site
   will operate in co-operation with ra.msstate.edu and the contents of
   its directories will form part of a union catalogue with ra.msstate
   and other co-operating sites.
 
   To subscribe, please send your request and a short biographical note
   to the owner:
      Daniel H. Bays

   HISTEC-L is a non-sectarian forum for discussion, debate, and the
   exchange of information by students and scholars of the history of
   evangelical Christianity.  It is not a medium for proselytizing, and
   the advocacy or disparagement of any faith or sect are not welcome.
   Requests for SUBscription pass through the list owner, and SEND and
   REVIEW commands are restricted to list members.  The command language
   of HISTEC-L is English, but postings in other languages are accepted.
   HISTEC-L is ready to distribute newsletters from study groups, and to
   post announcements of meetings and calls for papers, short scholarly
   pieces, queries, and other items of interest.

HL-7@VIRGINIA.EDU  
    	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]
       
                   HL-7 (Health Level Seven) Conference

   HL-7 is an electronic conference designed to foster communication
   concerning technical, operational, and business issues involved in
   the use of the HL-7 interface protocol.  It is also intended as a
   forum for the HL-7 Working Group members who are participating in the
   specification of the interface protocol.

   Health Level Seven is an application protocol for electronic data
   exchange in health care environments.  It is called level seven
   because the protocol assumes the underlying network support of levels
   one through six of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network
   model of the International Standards Organization (ISO).  The HL-7
   standard is specified at the seventh level, which is the application
   level.

   This HL-7 (Health Level Seven) Conference is *not* an offical part of
   the HL-7 Working Group and Executive Committee.  Official inquiries
   concerning HL-7 (Health Level Seven) should be sent directly to:
   Health Level Seven, P.O.  Box 66111, Chicago, IL 60666-9998, fax:
   (708) 616-9099.  In accordance with current CREN regulations,
   commercial activity (such as the selling of software) will be
   prohibited.  Subscription to this conference is open to *anyone*
   interested.

   You may subscribe by sending an e-mail message to:

      HL-7-REQUEST@VIRGINIA.EDU

   if your account is on the internet, with the following request as the
   text of the message.

      SUB HL-7 YourFirstname YourLastname

   This, the 'SUB ...,' must be part of the message;  the subject line
   will be ignored.

   Remember two simple rules-of-thumb:

   If it's a request (SUBscribe, UNSUBscribe), send it to the list
   requester (HL-7-REQUEST@VIRGINIA.EDU).

   If it's a message for general distribution to the members of the
   list, send it to the list (HL-7@VIRGINIA.EDU).

   The list is supported by the University of Virginia Medical Center
   Computing.  Our thanks to their management and staff for permission
   to use their system for the list and for assistance in setting it up.
   The list is sponsored by the University of Virginia Health Sciences
   Center.  Questions may be directed to David John Marotta.

	[Last Updated 28-January-1992]

   This list is a mechanism for periodically distributing a compendium
   of postings made to HOCKEY-L for those folks interested in the
   information on HOCKEY-L, but wish to limit the number of arriving
   E-Mail files, and do not wish to participate in the discussions.

   The HOCKEY-L list is for the discussion of collegiate ice hockey,
   including scores, team info, schedules, etc.  allowing fans to become
   more involved and knowledgeable about the game.

   The list resides at the University of Maine System MAINE.MAINE.EDU
   cpu.  When the owner posts a digest to the list, LISTSERV distributes
   a copy to everyone subscribed.  An archive of the digest is also
   created on a disk of LISTSERV.  Each digest posting is a separate
   file on that disk.

   HOCKEY-D does not accept postings;  it merely distributes a periodic
   collection of postings from another list, HOCKEY-L.  Subscription
   information for HOCKEY-D or HOCKEY-L may be requested from Wayne
   Smith at WTS@MAINE.MAINE.EDU.

   Send a request to sign off the list or ask for an archived file to
   LISTSERV@MAINE.MAINE.EDU as described below.

   Questions, comments and problems may be sent to the HOCKEY-D list
   owner Wayne Smith at WTS@MAINE.MAINE.EDU.

   The opinions expressed on HOCKEY-D are those of the posters and not
   of the University of Maine System nor of the list owner.

HOSPEX@PLEARN.BITNET
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   I am formally announcing the existence of a new list/database
   named HOSPEX@PLEARN which was created to provide those interested
   in being a host to foreign visitors a way to satisfy their interests.
   For those interested in finding a host when they are traveling
   in difference countries, this new database will satisfy this interest.
   I encourage everyone to subscribe to HOSPEX now.

   To subscribe just send a mailpiece stating that you want to join
   to HOSPEX@PLEARN. This will be automatically forwarded to one
   of the owners. Of course issuing standard
    'SUB HOSPEX your full name'
   to LISTSERV@PLEARN will do as well. You'll be sent a "fill in"
   form to be filled and returned. This subsribtion procedure
   is manual, so it may take few days sometimes.

   We are looking for lots of users outside the U.S. to subscribe
   (and U.S. users too, but now there is many more U.S. users than
   an other nation).

   Eventually, those who subscribe will be asked to send us a form
   which describes something about yourself, the type of accommodations
   you have, languages you speak, restrictions you want, etc.  When
   a file exists with this information on you, those traveling can
   look through all the files for the countries in which they will
   be traveling to find a host that seems interesting them.  So, this
   information you must eventually send to one of HOSPEX owners is
   important.

HSPNET-L on LISTSERV@ALBNYDH2
   Hospital Computer Network Discussion Group and Data Base

   HSPNET-L provides consultation, a monthly digest, and a data base of
   hospital networks.  It emphasizes restoration and extension of
   consulting for rural hospitals by connection to major medical
   centers.  All aspects (hardware, software, staff training,
   confidentiality of patient data, etc) will be covered.  Particular
   attention will be paid to existing networks both in USA and abroad.

   Transmission of both text and medical image data will be considered
   via both land- lines and satellite.  The cost-effectiveness of such
   distance-consulting will be reviewed in the light of declining rural
   hospital acute-care capabilities, and the economic benefits of
   keeping the patient in the rural area.

HUMAN-NETS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Mailing list originally consisting of the combined memberships of 
   INFO-PCNET, HOME-SAT, and TELETEXT mailing lists.  Human-Nets has discussed
   many topics, all of them related in some way to the theme of a world-wide 
   computer and telecommunications network usually called WorldNet.  The 
   topics have ranged very widely, from something like tutorials, to state of 
   the art discussions, to rampant speculation about technology and its 
   impact.  The list is extremely large, making it necessary to batch messages
   sent to the list and distributing them once each day during off peak 
   periods to avoid overloading the system.

   The permanent archives contain all of the material distributed to the list.
   Due to size, this archive is broken down into several different files, 
   stored in reverse temporal order.  The files are currently stored on 
   ARPANet host RU-BLUE in files RHYTHM:<PLEASANT.HUMAN-NETS>HUMNET.* (where 
   "*" is a wild-card).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to HUMAN-NETS-REQUEST@ARAMIS.RUTGERS.EDU.

   in 13 countries in North America, Europe, and the Near East.  Relevant 
   topics are technical questions about hardware and software, specific 
   problems in humanistic scholarship, and both the administrative 
   difficulties and philosophical issues arising from the application of 
   computing to the humanities; calls for papers, bibliographies, and reports 
   of lasting interest are also welcome.

   Interested individuals should send a note together with a brief biography 
   to the Coordinator in the following format:

      *Family-name, Given-names <e-mail address>

      Title, mailing address(es), telephone number(s).

      Body of biography.  This should not be a c.v. and need not be very 
      detailed but should cover the full range of your professional activities
      and interests, both present and past.  Mention other things at your 
      discretion.  Biographies vary considerably in length, though few are 
      less than 100 words or more than 500.

HUNGARY on LISTSERV@UCSBVM   Hungarian Discussion Group

   A new electronic discussion group on Hungarian issues is now open to
   scholars and students from all disciplines.  Although the working
   language of the group is English, contributions in other languages
   will be accepted and posted.  However, they may not be understood by
   a significant proportion of the membership.

   Electronic mail connections have already been established with three
   Hungarian universities: Budapest Technical University, Budapest
   University of Economic Sciences, and Eotvos Lorand University.

   The group and list server addresses of the new group, based at the
   University of California, Santa Barbara, are:

      hungary@ucsbvm.bitnet    For mail to broadcast to the list ONLY
      listserv@ucsbvm.bitnet   For commands or to subscribe

   any subject, to the list server address, listserv@ucsbvm.bitnet,
   containing the single line:

      subscribe hungary "your name"

   with your own name, not your e-mail address, inserted in place of the
   phrase "your name," without quotes.

HYPBAR-L on LISTSERV@TECHNION (LISTSERV@TECHNION.TECHNION.AC.IL)

   HyperBaric & Diving Medicine List

   HYPBAR-L is a new list to provide an unmoderated environment where
   issues, questions, comments, ideas, and procedures can be discussed.
   In a broad sense, this includes virtually anything dealing with
   medicine in relation to diving and HyperBaric Medicine.

   The explicit purpose of HYPBAR-L is to provide timely interchange
   between subscribers, to provide a forum where interesting questions
   can be addressed within the context of interactive exchange between
   many individuals, to discuss the evolution and application of
   HyperBaric and Diving Medicine, to announce professional meetings,
   calls for papers, and any additional information that would be of
   interest.

   As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the discussion and topics
   are only limited by the participation and interest of its
   subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an active role by
   posting and/or an inactive role by monitoring the list.  Although not
   necessary for participation, it shall be assumed that all subscribers
   are basically familiar with the medical jargon that is used on this
   list.

   To subscribe to HYPBAR-L, please send mail or file to
   LISTSERV@TECHNION or listserv@technion.technion.ac.il and place in
   the body of the text the line

   SUB HYPBAR-L <your name>.

   This list does not support nor is supported by any medical group or
   medical installation.  This list was created due to requests by
   several individuals within the medical community located in different
   countries.

   and  mutual assistance concerning:
	AmigaVision		InterActor
	CanDo			PILOT
	DeluxeVideo III		ShowMaker
	Director 2		TACL
	Foundation		Thinker
	Hyperbook		VIVA

   If you'd like to join us to discuss your hypermedia projects on the
   Amiga and ask questions about how to get them working better, send
   a mail request to hyperami's new home, the OIT listserver, like so:
	mail listserv@archive.oit.unc.edu
   and give a one-line message (it can be the subject) asking
	subscribe hyperami
   and you're on.  (Yes, it's automagic now.  Whee!)

   (You can also ask the listserver for "help" if you want more info;
   same idea, a one-line request.  For now there's no "index" listing
   for hyperami, though.)
   
   This list is separate from the Usenet newsgroup comp.sys.amiga.multimedia
   (by request of the listmembers) but material from the list may
   occasionally be presented to the newsgroup.

   Discussion of the BBoard package.  BBoard is a VMS utility to link mail, 
   delivered by Jnet, and VAX Notes, an electronic conferencing system from 
   Digital Equipment Corp.  BBoard's primary purpose is to reduce the number 
   of LISTSERV or mailing list subscribers at a node so that only one user 
   (BBOARD) is subscribed.  The messages from each mailing list will then be 
   posted in a separate Notes conference.

   There is no automated archive retrieval facility.  However, requests for 
   archived material may be sent to the I-BBReq address below.

   Requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

I-Finger%SPCVXA.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   Discussion of the Finger program and related utilities.  Finger is a 
   utility which performs username lookup, WHOIS functions, and system status 
   functions. This list is hosted on the system where VMS Finger and RSTS/E 
   Finger are maintained, so initial discussions will probably center around 
   these versions.  However, discussions about any Finger variant or similar 
   utilities are welcomed.

   There is no automated archive retrieval facility, however requests for 
   archived material may be sent to the I-FinReq/I-FINREQ address below.

   Requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions, 
   etc., should be sent to I-FinReq%SPCVXA.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU (Internet)

IAMEX-L on LISTSERV@TECMTYVM  (BITNET)
        or LISTSERV@TECMTYVM.MTY.ITESM.MX  (INTERNET)

   I am glad to inform you that we just opened a list of artificial
   intelligence, with the purpose to change ideas from Latinoamerica and
   the rest of the world, this list will look general topics (medicine,
   mechanical engineering, games, electronics, administration, etc), we
   will show applications, discussions, ideas of AI in this areas.  We
   will be glad if you decide to join us.  Some information of the list:

   Artificial Intelligence list of ITESM.

   ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is a very powerful tool, and still very new.
   Some Thoughts about this topic are very dissapointed, the reason of
   it, it is that AI is a unknown area for most of the people, or it
   seems to them that ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is more theorical than
   practical.  The PURPOSE of this list is to present to the people,
   there is a practical use for this science, and its technics are very
   useful for the understanding of the knowledge.  Letting knowing to
   the people how we are developing this area in Mexico, and other
   countries.  This will be done in the following way:

   1) Answering questions (doubts about a topic from a class, project,etc)
   2) Presenting and discussion of interviews from experts
   3) Presenting and discussion projects around the world
   4) Sending out a periodical general information about a topic
   5) Sending out information about simposiums, meetings, bibliography, etc.

   This project is administrated by the AI Invetigation Center in
   Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM)
   in Monterrey, N.L.

   The people who are interesting about subscribing this list must fill
   these requirements:

   1:  Be a student, investigator, profesor who are interesting and have
       some knowledge of this area
   2:  Must fill the registration form, please ask for it to owners.

   To Be Added to the List Please Contact one of the Owners:

        PL157961@TECMTYVM.BITNET (Fernando Careaga Sanchez)

   Note:  There is an old "Arpanet" to BITNET redistribution list
    called AILIST at our site.  However, it has been dormant for several
    years and would not emphasize work in Latin America as this list
    would.  If we do restart the list it will probably be as an e-mail
    gateway with an active news group anyway.  mgh

IBM-SRD on LISTSERV@NDSUVM1         IBM Screen Reader Product
        or LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu

   IBM-SRD is a discussion list for thongs relating to the IBM Screen
   Reader Product.

   The IBM Screen reader is a hardware/software combination that enables
   a blind user to navigate around the screen when a speech synthesizer
   is attatched to the computer.  What I hope to establish is a user's
   forum to discuss aspects of the use and programming of Screen Reader.

   The list can be subscribed to by sending mail to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 on
   BITNET (or LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu) with the TEXT of the mail saying:
      SUB IBM-SRD yourfirstname yourlastname

   There will also be an archive site at ndsuvm1 of Screen Reader
   materials - essentially source code in Screen Reader's Profile Access
   Language which is the mechanism one uses to teach Screen Reader about
   different application programs.  For e-mail access send mail to
   LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 (or LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu) with the commands
      INDEX IBM-SRD
      GET SRD-0001 README
   in the text (body) of the message.  (Be sure to send these to LISTSERV
   and NOT to the list).

   You may also use FTP to connect to vm1.nodak.edu (134.129.111.1)
   using userid anonymous and any password.  Enter  CD IBM-SRD  and

INFO-1100@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU

   This discussion list focuses on the Xerox/Envos Lisp environment and the 
   associated protocols.  Its purpose is to stimulate communication and 
   sharing between computer science research groups that use or are interested
   in the environment.  The list may be used for messages such as 
   announcements of available lispusers packages or for queries such as "Does 
   anybody know of a PUP file server implementation for the Sinclair ZX-80?" 
   or to warn others of Interlisp-D and Medley bugs and/or suggest workarounds
   or to solicit help or discussion.

   Xerox PARC, SIS, and Envos people are included in the distribution to 
   facilitate communication about new developments, bugs, performance issues, 
   etc..  Additionally, Info-1100 is automatically forwarded to 
   AISupport.pasa@Xerox.com, where bugs are noted and acted upon if 
   appropriate.  Xerox AIS and Envos employees will not respond in Info-1100 
   unless the reply is of general interest or silence would mislead the 
   readership.  This mailing list is also distributed as the usenet newsgroup 
   comp.sys.xerox.

   A historical note describing the name:  The Lisp environment was originally
   implemented on Xerox' 1100-series workstations, and the user base is 
   primarily still on 1108's, 1109's, and 1186's.

   Archives of messages are kept on SUMEX-AIM in directory <BBOARD> in files:

INFO-68K@BERKELEY.EDU

   Mailing list for users of OS's capable of running on small 68000 systems, 
   primarly CP/M-68K.  Related systems (OS/9-68K, etc.) and topics welcome.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 68K-ARCHIV.TXT. 
   The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.68K>

info-ada@AJPO.SEI.CMU.EDU

   Mailing list for announcements, questions and discussions of a technical 
   nature, requests for information, and just about anything else having to do
   with the Ada programming language (ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-1983).

   Messages are collected and automatically digested on a daily basis for mail
   distribution via WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.  Individual messages are
   bidirectionally gatewayed with the USENET newsgroup comp.lang.ada.  The list
   is redistributed for BITNet, EARN, and NetNorth via the peered lists
   INFO-ADA@NDSUVM1 and INFO-ADA@FINHUTC on BITNet and EARN; both sites run
   Eric Thomas's LISTSERV.

   Archives of messages can be found on host AJPO.SEI.CMU.EDU in the files 
   ~ftp/public/infoada/* (the path name is case-sensitive), and are available 
   to DDN users via anonymous FTP.

   All Internet requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, 
   etc., should be sent to info-ada-request@AJPO.SEI.CMU.EDU.  BITNet, EARN, 
   and NetNorth users can subscribe by sending the SUB command with your name;
   for example:
       SEND LISTSERV@host    SUB INFO-APP your_full_name
   or  TELL LISTSERV AT host SUB INFO-APP your_full_name
   To be removed from the list,
       SEND LISTSERV@host    SIGNOFF INFO-APP
   or  TELL LISTSERV AT host SIGNOFF INFO-APP
   where "host" is NDSUVM1 or FINHUTC and "your_full_name" is your name (NOT 
   your net address).

   Coordinator: Gene Rackow <rackow@MCS.ANL.GOV>

Info-Andrew@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

   An informal mailing list intended for general discussion by recipients of 
   the Andrew distribution (and implementors of Andrew).  Andrew, a joint 
   project of Carnegie Mellon University & IBM, is a prototype computing 
   environment for academic and research use under the UNIX operating system. 
   There are four main parts to Andrew:

      - The Andrew File System (AFS), a large-scale distributed central
        file system.
      - The Andrew Toolkit (ATK), a toolkit for building complex graphical
        user interface programs in a window-manager independent way
        (currently runs on X11 and the old Andrew window manager)
      - The Andrew Message System (AMS), a multi-media mail and bulletin
        board system compatible with non-multi-media systems
      - The Andrew application programs, a suite of programs that use the
        ATK to provide various useful features.

   Topics can include (but are not limited to):

      - hints about using/building Andrew
      - discussions about desired features, changes, etc.
      - comments about the Andrew distribution (e.g., "it stinks", "it's
        great")
      - questions about the availability/existence of other parts of Andrew

   The mailing list is available in both Andrew multi-media format (if you 
   have the AMS up and running) and plain-text format.  By default you will be
   sent plain-text versions of the posts, but you can request a change in 
   which version you receive by sending mail to the -Request address.  When 
   sending a message to this list, you should feel free to include any 
   multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.) which might help to express 
   you question, comment, etc.  Such images will automatically be stripped out
   and replaced by "A picture appeared here" before being redistributed to the
   plain-text recipients.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Andrew-Request@ANDREW.CMU.EDU.  NOTE: All 
   subscription requests will also be added to the Info-Andrew-Bugs 
   distribution list unless specifically requested not to.

   Coordinator: Adam Stoller <ghoti+@ANDREW.CMU.EDU>

Info-Andrew-Bugs@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

   Mailing list for reporting bugs/problems with the Andrew distribution.  
   (See Info-Andrew entry for more detailed description on what "Andrew" is). 
   Official responses to queries and bug reports will be posted to this 
   mailing list.  Topics include:

      - problems discovered in building the distribution
      - problems discovered in running parts of the distribution
      - questions about difficulties encountered (even if you're not sure
        they're bugs)

   When sending a message to this list, you should feel free to include any 
   multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.), that might help to clarify 
   a bug report.  Such images will automatically be stripped out and replaced 
   by "A picture appeared here" before being redistributed to the plain-text 
   recipients.

   The list will be moderated, so that all bugs can be tracked and referenced 
   with patch files.  We expect that posts will go out to the subscribers 
   about once a week, summarizing those reports which have been fixed and 
   those still being looked into.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Andrew-Bugs-Request@ANDREW.CMU.EDU.  NOTE: All
   subscription requests will also be added to the Info-Andrew distribution 
   list unless specifically requested not to.

   Coordinator: Adam Stoller <ghoti+@ANDREW.CMU.EDU>

INFO-APPLE@BRL.MIL

   APPLE II series user's mailing list.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   APPLE-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.APPLE>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Apple-Request@BRL.MIL.

   INFO-APP@NDSUVM1 is the BITNET/NetNorth/EARN Redistribution for the ARPANET
   list.  BITNET, EARN, or NetNorth subscribers can join by sending the SUB 
   command with your name; for example:
       SEND LISTSERV@NDSUVM1    SUB INFO-APP Jon Doe
   or  TELL LISTSERV AT NDSUVM1 SUB INFO-APP Jon Doe
   To be removed from the list,
       SEND LISTSERV@NDSUVM1    SIGNOFF INFO-APP
   or  TELL LISTSERV AT NDSUVM1 SIGNOFF INFO-APP
   To MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS to the list, BitNet, EARN, and Netnorth users should 
   send mail to the ARPANet list name: Info-Apple@BRL.MIL, NOT to the BITNET 
   list name!

Info-AS400@Joiner.BITNET       IBM AS/400 Discussion
   or Info-AS400@Joiner.COM

   This is a "how-to" discussion on IBM AS/400 architecture, systems,
   and software.  It is for the discussion of most topics, including
   hardware, systems and applications programming, networking, and
   connectivity.  IBM and third-party solutions may be discussed.

   The list is primarily aimed at system administrators, managers, and
   programmers.  Because this is an Internet/BITNET list, the use of
   AS/400 systems in research and education, and in the context of
   cooperative interational networks, is certain to be of interest.

   It is hoped that beginners will turn to the list for answers to their
   questions, and that more experienced participants will provide gentle
   answers.

   These topics should be avoided, as they will get in the way of our
   discussions of how to solve real problems with the systems we have:
   (1) the merits of IBM AS/400 products relative to their competitors,
   (2) product announcements, and (3) IBM bashing.  (Other topics may be
   added to this list in the future.)

   Owner:   Info-AS400-Request@Joiner.COM (IBM AS/400 Discussion Coordinator)
            Arnold@Joiner.COM (Stephen L. Arnold)

   Notebooks:  No

   Notes:

   1.  This list is unmoderated.  Submissions to Info-AS400@Joiner
   (Info-AS400@Joiner.COM) are immediately forwarded to the list.

   2.  This is not a LISTSERV list and requests for list changes are
   handled manually by the coordinator.  Send requests to update the list
   to Info-AS400-Request@Joiner.COM.  The list is a PMDF distribution list
   hosted on a VAX system running VMS.

   3.  Contributions sent to this list are manually archived.  Requests for
   old postings will be answered by the coordinator.  Send such requests to
   Info-AS400-Request@Joiner.COM.  If there is sufficient demand for auto-
   matic subscription and archive service, I'll explore ways to provide it.


INFO-ATARI <INFO-ATARI8@NAUCSE.CSE.NAU.EDU>
           <INFO-ATARI16@NAUCSE.CSE.NAU.EDU>
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   Discussions of 8- and 16-bit Atari computers and related topics.  
   Commercial messages and advertisements are not permitted.

      LISTSERV provides access to files for everyone who can send mail, 
      independent of their location.  On Bitnet messages should be sent to 
      your nearest LISTSERV (the one from which you receive the info-atari 
      digests); if your address is not on Bitnet, an address for file servers 
      is given below.  All mail sent to LISTSERV contains command lines.  
      LISTSERV will respond by return mail.  No subject is necessary in such 
      mail.  For more information send the command
         INFO

         The list_name for 16-bit Ataris is INFO-A16.  The list_name for 8-bit
         Ataris is INFO-A8.  These list names are used by Bitnet addressees 
         for subscribing and unsubscribing and by everyone for obtaining back 
         copies of news digests.  The list_names for programs stored in the 
         archives are PROG-A16 and PROG-A8.

         You can obtain copies of files from LISTSERV by sending a message in 
         the specified format.  To obtain a list of files in the file server, 
         the command is
            INDEX list_name
         The command to obtain a specific file is
            GET list_name file_name
         for example, GET INFO-A16 87-00076
         If you want to learn more, send the message
           HELP

         If you are on Bitnet you may add or remove yourself from the 
         distribution list.  The command to join the list is
            SUBSCRIBE list_name User_name
         The command to remove yourself from the list is
            UNSUBSCRIBE list_name

         If you are on ARPAnet (or gatewayed to it), your mail concerning 
         16-bit Atari information should be addressed to 
         LISTSERV%CANADA01.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU.  Mail concerning 8-bit 
         Atari information should be addressed to 
         LISTSERV%TCSVM.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU.

   Administrative messages should be sent to 
   info-atari8-request@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU or 
   info-atari16-request@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU.

INFO-DSEE@APOLLO.COM

   Discussion of DSEE, a software engineering environment from Apollo in 
   wide-spread use by tens of thousands of programmers, on projects up to 
   5,000,000 lines of code.

   DSEE elegantly and efficiently solves many common problems -- how to work 
   on multiple versions of a program at a time, how to tell when someone has 
   made a change you need to know about, how to develop software for multiple 
   target machines, how to KNOW the right version of each source file was 
   used, etc.

   If all this sounds like hype, join the mailing list, and listen to users.

   At least initially, the list will not be moderated or digested; if the 
   volume is sufficient, this may change.  Mail to the list will be archived 
   in some public place that will be announced at a later date.

info-frame@AEROSPACE.AERO.ORG

   Mailing list for System Frameworks.  This group is designed to provide 
   information for software tool developers that are responsible for 
   integrating heterogenous software products.  This can include in-house and 
   vendor supplied.  Usually, the integration of the products is designed to 
   provide an environment that makes using the tools easier.  The basic issue 
   is to build a `framework' around the tools that provides a common and 
   consistent view of the system.  The framework is not limited to homogeneous
   environments, but also can span heterogeneous systems.  Companies like EDA 
   and government sponsored projects like EIS are trying to tackle this 
   problem.  This group can be viewed as a forum for users and developers to 
   voice their opinions on this subject.  Frameworks are common in the area of
   CAD/CAE, CASE and office automation; but they are not limited to only these
   areas.  Topics open for discussion are:

      Tool encapsulation    Data Management             Network Computing
      User Interface        Data Transfer Languages     Tool Portability
      Process Control/Flow  Object Programming          Anything Else

INFO-FUTURES@ENCORE.COM
...{bu-cs,decvax,necntc,talcott}!encore!info-futures (UUCP)

   Digest to provide a speculative forum for analyzing current and likely 
   events in technology as they will affect our near future in computing and 
   related areas.  In broad terms, topics of interest include developments in 
   both computing research and industry which are likely to affect our 
   decision making, particularly decisions we are probably grappling with 
   right this minute.  Technologies can change so rapidly that simply 
   forecasting for needs within any organization one or two years in advance 
   can be extremely difficult, frequently we are forced to provide foundations
   that effectively lock us into a technology for longer periods of time. It 
   is hoped the information this list provides can help both the practitioner 
   and researcher determine where best to expend resources.

info-gnu-msdos@wugate.wustl.edu -- The GNUISH MsDos Development Group

   The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is not directly interested in
   integrating or maintaining ports of GNU software to MS-DOS, because of
   limited resources.  These activities take time away from finishing a
   complete standalone GNU, which FSF and many in the GNU Project
   considers much more important.

   There is a mailing list to discuss these MsDos ports of GNU
   software.  It is called info-gnu-msdos@wugate.wustl.edu.  It is
   managed by an experimental Unix-based listserv program.  Send
   the command:

    add info-gnu-msdos
   to:
    listserv@wugate.wustl.edu

   to become subscribed to the list.  Send a message containing only
   'help' to get more information about the listserv.  Do not send these
   commands to info-gnu-msdos.  They should go to the listserv address.

   The list is not moderated, not digestified, and open to subscription
   by anyone.  Problems with the mailing list should be directed to:

    info-gnu-msdos-request@wugate.wustl.edu

   To get more information about the GNUISH project, look at the file
   on wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) in the mirrors/msdos/gnuish

   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in HAMS-ARCHIV.TXT.
    The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.HAMS>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP for those with TCP/IP access 
   to the Internet.

   Phil Howard KA9WGN <PHIL%UIUCVMD.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU> also archives the 
   INFO-HAMS mailing list on BITNET node UIUCVMD using the LISTSERV mailing 
   list server (subscriptions disabled for this).  Users on BITNET may request
   files to be sent to them by sending commands, either by interactive message
   or in the message body by mail, to the address LISTSERV@UIUCVMD.  The 
   command to see the current online list of files is:
      INDEX INFOHAMS
   (Note there is no dash "-").  To obtain volume 88 issue 73, send the 
   command:
      GET INFOHAMS 88-00073
   INFO-HAMS is a digested mailing list, and each digest is available 
   separately from LISTSERV@UIUCVMD.

   All ARPANet/MilNet requests to be added to or deleted from this list, 
   problems, questions, etc., should be sent to 
   INFO-HAMS-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

Info-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   Info-IBMPC is a forum for technical discussion of the IBM Personal Computer
   and compatible micro-computers, providing a way for interested members of 
   the Internet community to compare notes, ask questions, and share insights 
   of a technical nature about these machines.  While it is not primarily a 
   consumer's guide to the IBM PC, the digest may also be useful for that 
   purpose.

   Messages are collected, edited into digests and distributed as the volume 
   of mail dictates (generally twice a week).  All messages regarding hardware
   for IBM PCs, PC and compatibles and software are welcomed; messages on 
   other topics will not be run.  In addition, two topics are taboo and are 
   routinely edited out: (1) self promotion of products for sale, and (2) 
   anything about copy protection.

   An archive of back issues and a program library are available to those with
   FTP access (essentially anyone on the Internet).  Digests are archived at 
   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL in PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> in <YYMM.1-TXT> format. 
   Digests from September 1982 through the current issue are available by 
   ANONYMOUS FTP login.

   A library of free software in binary and source code form is maintained at 
   SIMTEL20 in directory PD1:<MSDOS> and PD2:<MSDOS2>.  A list of all MS-DOS 
   programs available from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL is contained in 
   PD1:<MSDOS>FILES.IDX.  Donations of source code are welcomed.  Donated 
   programs must be truly free and public domain, with no fee or contribution 
   required or requested, and no license agreement.  To donate a program to 
   the library, send a description of the program along with a copy of the 
   source code to INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   Files may be FTP'ed by logging in to the SIMTEL20 FTP server with username 
   ANONYMOUS, password GUEST.  (Although GUEST is a perfectly good password, a
   password of <YOUR-NAME@YOUR-HOST> is preferred.)  For those subscribers 
   without Internet FTP access, a file transfer mechanism has been set up with
   RPIECS.bitnet.  For more details, send a message to 
   <LISTSERV@RPIECS.bitnet> with the first line of 'HELP' or ask the editor 
   for the Simtel-Bitnet FTP help file.  Requested files are mailed to those 
   users with a VALID Internet return address.

   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL can be accessed using LISTSERV commands from BITNET 
   and those users without Internet FTP access via LISTSERV@NDSUVM1, 
   LISTSERV@RPIECS, LISTSERV@FINTUVM and in Europe from EARN TRICKLE servers. 
   Send commands to LISTSERV or TRICKLE@<host-name> (example: TRICKLE@TREARN).
   The following TRICKLE servers are presently available: AWIWUW11 (Austria), 
   BANUFS11 (Belgium), DKTC11 (Denmark), DB0FUB11 (Germany), IMIPOLI (Italy), 
   EB0UB011 (Spain) TAUNIVM (Israel) and TREARN (Turkey).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   BITNET users must join the INFO-IBMPC distribution list through the BITNET 
   LISTSERV mechanism.  There are IBMPC-L BITNET sub-distribution lists at the
   following BITNET hosts: BNANDP11, UTORONTO, CEARN, DEARN, EB0UB011, 
   FINHUTC, HEARN, VTVM1, POLYGRAF, $$INFOPC@RICEVM1, TAMVM1, TAUNIVM, UBVM, 
   UGA, and VTVM2.  BitNet subscribers can join by sending a SUB command to 
   the nearest LISTSERV node or to <LISTSERV@POLYGRAF.bitnet>.  For example:
      SEND LISTSERV@CEARN SUB IBMPC-L Jon Doe
   To be removed from the list substitute the keyword "SIGNOFF" for "SUB".  To
   make contributions to the list, BITNET subscribers should send mail to 
   <INFO-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL> and NOT to the BITNET list name.

   For those users on USENET, the Digest is available from newsfeed 
   comp.sys.ibm.pc.digest.  Since the current editor does not have a USENET 
   feed, please include <INFO-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL> as a CC: address 
   on all messages sent to USENET.

   On BITNET, the archives can be obtained from DATABASE@BITNIC.BITNET and the
   program library can be obtained from CCUC@UMCVMB.BITNET.  The 
   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL FTP server may also be reached via 
   <LISTSERV%RPICICGE.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU>. For more details, send a 
   message to the above addresses with the first line of 'HELP'.

INFO-KERMIT@WATSUN.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU

   Kermit is a file transfer protocol developed at Columbia University in New 
   York City, USA, for use primarily between micros and mainframes over 
   asynchronous serial connections, dialed or direct, over public data 
   networks, etc.  Kermit programs that implement this protocol can transfer 
   textual as well as binary files over both 7-bit and 8-bit communication 
   links, singly or in groups.  As of this writing (May 1989), Kermit programs
   are available for nearly 350 different computers and operating systems.  
   The Info-Kermit mailing list is a digest intended for people who maintain 
   or install Kermit at their sites, or who are (thinking about) working on a 
   new implementation, or who have bugs and/or fixes to report, or who are 
   interested in discussing the protocol, and also for Kermit users.  The 
   digest is available on Internet, CSNET, MAILNET, BITNET, EARN, USENET, 
   CCNET, DEC EASYNET, and any other network gatewayed to the Internet.

   Info-Kermit archives are collected in kermit/e/imail.*, one file (paginaged
   and indexed) per volume, generally 2 volumes per year.  Other Kermit files 
   are also available via both Internet and BitNet/EARN and by mail order.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Kermit-Request@WATSON.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU or to

info-labview@pica.army.mil

   Info-LabVIEW is an internet mailing list for the discussion of the use of
   National Instruments' LabVIEW package for the Apple Macintosh.

                         =====================

    LabVIEW is a graphical software system for developing high-performance
    scientific and engineering applications. LabVIEW acquires data from
    IEEE-488 (GPIB), RS-232/422 and modular (VXI or CAMAC) instruments
    and plug-in data acquisition boards.

    LabVIEW programs, called "virtual instruments" (VIs), are created using
    icons, instead of conventional, text-based code. A VI consists of a front
    panel and a block diagram. The front panel (with knobs, switches, graphs,
    and so on) is the user interface. The block diagram, which is the
    executable code, consists of icons that operate on data connected by
    wires that pass data between them.
   [I swiped this description from National Instruments' promotional blurbs]
                         =====================

   The list is being run as a simple redistribution of all submitted messages.

   To post to the list, send your mail to <info-labview@pica.army.mil>. All
   administrative issues should go to <info-labview-request@pica.army.mil>.

   FTP archives are on caesar.pica.army.mil [129.139.160.200], /pub/labview.

INFO-M2%DB0TUI11.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
INFO-M2%UCF1VM.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   A discussion list for the Modula-2 programming language.  Modula-2 is a 
   language by Niklaus Wirth which extends the Pascal foundation by providing 
   an updated statement syntax (generalized LOOP, EXIT, RETURN, no GOTO), 
   separate compilation with a module (compilation unit) broken into 
   specification and implementation parts with importing and exporting of 
   objects, controlled machine level access, and concurrent programming and 
   coroutines.  Modula-2 has most of the power of Ada but is small enough that
   excellent full implementations exist for CP/M 80.

   Contributions may be sent to INFO-M2@ucf1vm.Bitnet (from the US) or to 
   INFO-M2@db0tui11.Bitnet (from Europe); these are both entry points for the 
   same list.

INFO-MAC@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU

   Network interest group for the Apple Macintosh computer. This list is
   SUMEX's contribution to the community of research and instructional
   developers and users of the Macintosh; all submissions of messages and
   programs in this spirit are welcome.

   For those sites with FTP access to SUMEX-AIM, archives for INFO-MAC are
   kept under {SUMEX-AIM}/info-mac/digest/infomacvM-NNN, where M is the
   volume number and NNN is the digest number.  These numbers have little to
   no bearing on reality.

   Programs submitted to the bulletin board, along with documentation files
   and other references are also stored in the info-mac directory.  With FTP
   access as user "anonymous" and any password, you can bring these files over
   to your host and download them to your Macintosh. "Usenet" and some of the
   other networks that copy info-mac will see sources redistributed at the time
   they are mentioned in the digest distributions.

   Messages to INFO-MAC@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU are scanned to filter out any
   list requests, questions previously answered, pure speculation or opinion,
   or message obviously not in line with the stated purpose of the list.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to INFO-MAC-REQUEST@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU.  Due to
   the size of this list, INFO-MAC only sends to relays, i.e. addresses such

BUG-MM@COLUMBIA.EDU

   The Info-MM/Bug-MM mailing lists are a way for Columbia-MM
   maintainers and sites running MM to communicate, distribute patches, 
   get bug reports, send comments, suggestions, enhancements, etc.

   Columbia-MM is a UNIX mail manager program based on the TOPS-20 MM
   program running on Digital Equipment Corporation DEC20 systems.
   Columbia-MM is written in C using the CCMD (TOPS-20 COMND Jsys in
   C) package developed at Columbia University, and thus has
   command/keyword/filename completion (on ESC or TAB), context
   sensitive help on "?", command history and command line editing.

   MM is compatible with various other mail programs, and has hooks
   for adding more in the future.  MM has support for several mail
   file formats: "mtxt" which is the MM-20 format on DEC20's, "mbox"
   used by UNIX mail(1), and "babyl" the format of Gnuemacs rmail
   mode.  Support for mh(1), pop (post office protocol), and usenet
   news are planned for the future.

   Sources are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from
   CUNIXF.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU [128.59.40.130] in the mm directory.

INFO-NETS@THINK.COM

   Mailing list for general discussion of networks, focusing on inter-network 
   connectivity.  Questions about connections to particular sites are very 
   common, as are discussions of new networks in the US and abroad.

   New archives are maintained on THINK.COM, and can be accessed via anonymous
   ftp as mail/info-nets.archives*.  Archives cannot be mailed, but they are 
   available on BITNIC for Bitnet users.  Old archives are not currently 
   available, but if demand warrants it may be possible to retrieve them.

   All non-BitNet requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
   questions, etc., should be sent to INFO-NETS-REQUEST@THINK.COM.  Multiple 
   users at a given site should create a local distribution list and request 
   that the local alias be added to the list, in order to reduce the load on 
   the THINK.COM mailer.

   There is a BitNet sub-distribution list, INFONETS@BITNIC; BitNet 
   subscribers can join by sending the SUB command with your name. For 
   example, SEND LISTSERV@BITNIC SUB INFONETS Jon Doe

   This is a mailing list for discussions about the ISO standard 8613 "Office 
   Document Architecture" (also known as the CCITT standard "Open Document 
   Architecture". Messages pertaining to the meaning of the standard, 
   extensions to it, implementations of it and demonstrations of it are 
   appropriate. Also appropriate are discussions of other multimedia document 
   representations, such as DSSSL.

INFO-PASCAL@BRL.MIL

   This list is intended for people who are interested in the programming 
   language Pascal.  Discussions of any Pascal implementation (from mainframe 
   to micro) are welcome.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   PASCAL-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.PASCAL>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   This list was started in the 1970's to discuss and begin implementing a 
   network of personal computers to extend the advantages of net-mail to the 
   large community of personal computer users.  A nearly complete 
   specification for the protocol layers and all protocols needed for mail and
   file transferm has been written.  A few partial implementations have been 
   done and one complete one.  Recently the list has not been very active, 
   although some discussion does occur.

   The archive of old messages is kept on AI.AI.MIT.EDU, in the file
      PCNET;INFPCN ARCHIV
   There is also extensive documentation and partial code which has been 
   migrated to backup tapes.

info-prograph@grove.iup.edu
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   Users of the Macintosh programming language Prograph now have their own
   Internet list! To subscribe to this new list, send an Email message to
   info-prograph-request@grove.iup.edu

    We aren't using any automated subscription process, so no special syntax is
    required.  Just say you want to subscribe, and I'll add your name to the list.
    Prograph, for those who have not seen it before, is an icon-based
    object-oriented programming language, published by TGS Systems, Halifax, Nova
    Scotia.  My only connection with TGS is that I own Prograph, and am
    beta-testing the 2.5 version, and that they have subscribed to the list.
 
    Prograph includes an application "shell", which makes it easy to quickly
    generate prototypes of your application.  Unlike other application generators,
    such as Serius Developer or AppMaker, Prograph is a complete and self-contained
    programming language, with full access to the Mac Toolbox (including System 7
    calls).  The versatile Interpreter lets you quickly test and debug your code,
    actually allowing you to add new code *while your app is running*!  Once you
    have your application debugged, the Compiler lets you turn it into a
    standalone, double-clickable Mac application, which you are free to distribute
    as you see fit (no licensing fees are required).

INFO-TMODEM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
   BUG-TMODEM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   The INFO-TMODEM list is a means for the maintainer of the TMODEM program to
   send notices to users of TMODEM.  Users of TMODEM send bug reports and 
   feature requests to BUG-TMODEM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   TMODEM is a new TOPS-20 implementation of the Christensen Protocol, with 
   all the latest features, such as:
      o  wildcard file transfers in the style of MODEM7
         (YMODEM batch is coming)
      o  the YMODEM implementation of the K option with a new algorithm
         to return to K mode after falling back to "normal" mode
      o  extensive built-in HELP for all commands and options.
   TMODEM is an amalgamation of the old TOPS-20 MODEM program, originally 
   written by Bill Westfield while he was at SRI and now at Stanford, major 
   pieces of the TOPS-20 TELNET program, currently maintained by Mark Crispin,
   and some pieces of code stolen from TTLINK and KERMIT-20 by Frank da Cruz 
   at Columbia University.

   The archives for replaced mailing list INFO-MODEMXX are frozen on host 
   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files named yymm.n-TXT, where n 
   starts with one and increments by one into another file as each file 
   reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, all the mail files in the 
   archive, except for the current year, are individually compressed.  The 
   compressed files have the suffix -Z as part of the filetype field; they 
   should be renamed to have the suffix .Z (uppercase Z) when transfered to a 
   Unix system so the uncompress program will find them.  The current month's 
   mail is still kept in MODEMXX-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in 
   directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

INFO-TPU@SHSU.BITNET  Digital's Text Processing Utility

   INFO-TPU is a new list to provide an unmoderated environment where
   issues, questions, comments, ideas, and uses of Digital's TPU (Text
   Processing Utility) language can be discussed.

   The explicit purpose of INFO-TPU is to provide timely interchange
   between subscribers, to provide a forum where interesting questions
   can be addressed within the context of interactive exchange between
   many individuals, to discuss the evolution and application of TPU.
   The discussions of INFO-TPU will be archived and available for
   reference.  Additionally, it is hoped that INFO-TPU will be able to
   serve as a repository for interesting TPU applications placed in the
   public domain.  As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the
   discussion and topics are only limited by the participation and
   interest of its subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an
   active role by posting to INFO-TPU or an inactive role by monitoring
   the list.

   To subscribe to INFO-TPU, please send a MAIL message to:

   INFO-UNIX.  Hopefully, enough people who know some answers will subscribe 
   so that the list serves a purpose; some overlap is expected with the 
   UNIX-WIZARDS list.

   users of Ingres at the universities of Delft and Rotterdam; such messages 
   may be in Dutch, but should begin with a warning that they are intended for
   these users only.

   Discussion may include any topic related to the subject, such as problems 
   in implementing, tuning or using the product in any environment (MS/DOS, 
   UNIX, VMS, CMS, MVS or a combination of any of these), conversion to new 
   versions (such as from Version-5 to Version-6), announcements of 
   conferences, etc.

   BitNet users may subscribe by sending the following command:
      TELL LISTSERV AT HDETUD1 SUBSCRIBE INGRES-L your_full_name
   (where "your_full_name" is your real name, not your login Id) or the 
   equivalent in VMS, UNIX or whichever Operating System your account uses, or
   send the same message (SUBSCRIBE etc.) in the BODY or TEXT of mail to 
   LISTSERV@HDETUD1.BITNET.  Non-BitNet users can join by sending the 
   SUBSCRIBE command to LISTSERV%HDETUD1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

INGRAFX on LISTSERV@PSUVM
   CARTOGRAPHY, INFO GRAPHICS, SCI-VIZ, AND RELATED AREAS

   Hello!  INGRAFX is a new listserv devoted to the interdisciplinary
   areas of cartography, information graphics and scientific
   visualization.  As owner of the list, I would like to invite all
   those who have an interest in the broad range of images known as
   "graphics" (maps, photographs, drawings and information or
   quantitative graphics) to consider signing up.

   Please do not take these requirements too formally!  Ideally, the
   discussion will be uninhibited and free-flowing.

   Candidate topics for discussion might be;  the relation of maps to
   graphics as a whole (are they different kinds of representation?);
   the philosophy of graphic representation (what theories are there of
   graphic representations, and how does a graphic "represent" segments
   of the world);  how can we use graphics in education;  to what extent
   does "graphicacy" matter in today's world;  what is the relationship
   between academic or scientific graphics, and graphics in the popular
   media;  can we or should we accrue rules for "good" graphics;  are
   there graphic variables or elements that are basic to all graphics,
   and can these be used in animation?

   In general our aim is for an *informal* discussion which is
   cross-disciplinary, and about graphics.

                       ***How to Join in***

   Curious to see what's going on so far?  Why not sign up now?

   Sign up in the usual way for LISTSERVs, i.e., send mail to
   LISTSERV@PSUVM on BITNET or LISTSERV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU on Internet
   with the following command in the TEXT:
      SUB INGRAFX your firstname and last name

   Once you are a subscriber you can retrieve any files that have been
   archived on the listserv, including the monthly discussion logs, and
   other files of interest.  To see what is there, either TELL or send a
   email note to LISTSERV AT PSUVM or LISTSERV AT PSUVM.PSU.EDU with the
   command INDEX INGRAFX .  Once you have decided on a file you can
   retrieve it by using the GET command.  E.g.,
   TELL LISTSERV AT PSUVM GET 'File name', or GET 'Another file'.

   Post by sending email to ingrafx@psuvm.

   Owner:    "Jeremy Crampton" <ELE@PSUVM> or <ele@psuvm.psu.edu>

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                  ***Future Discussions on the List***

   As a geographer/cartographer, I am particularly interested in getting
   fellow cartographers to join in the debate.  Especially students.
   However, one of the goals of the list is to broaden cartographic
   debate to include consideration of the many forms and roles of
   graphics in today's highly visual world.

   To this end, the list will be interdisciplinary.  It will seek to
   include people from the worlds of information graphics (see the
   work by Edward Tufte for one position on this), scientific
   visualization, and the media (_USA Today_ style graphics?...)

   To my knowledge there does not yet exist such an interdisciplinary
   forum for the discussion of graphics as a whole.

   I would also like to have people share their graphics.  This can
   be done by compressing and converting a file to binary form.  I
   do not encourage posting of these files to the list, but those
   people interested in swapping graphics should describe what they
   have, and what they'd like to see, on the INGRAFX list.

   Transactions could then take place over private email, with a list
   of available graphics being held in our archives.

   Reviews, either of software, books or articles on graphics, are also
   especially encouraged.  If you have been asked to write one and can't
   wait to see it in "print," send it to INGRAFX (retaining your
   copyright).

   We aim to create an informal environment for the discussion
   of all issues related to graphics.  This might also include
   discussion of ideas you are working on for future articles,
   or research projects announcements of job openings, interesting
   graphics you have discovered, or just general commentary with a
   graphic flavor.

IOUDAIOS%YORKVM1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
IOUDAIOS on LISTSERV@YORKVM1  First Century Judaism

   IOUDAIOS (Greek for "Jew") is an electronic seminar devoted to the
   exploration of first-century Judaism;  its special interest is in the
   writings of Philo of Alexandria and Flavius Josephus.  The list began
   as an informal discussion of two papers by Robert A. Kraft
   (Pennsylvania) but quickly blossomed into an international forum, with
   participants in North America, Europe, Australia, and The Middle East.

   The Philonic and Josephan corpora are extensive enough that they
   invite all sorts of analysis -- from literary, historical, and
   philosophical perspectives, to name a few.  There is also considerable
   interest, among participants, in the social realities that lie behind
   these texts.  Prospective members are warmly welcomed.  (The
   discussion assumes a significant background in first-century Judaism
   and also the ability to read Greek.)

   To subscribe to this list send a mail/note message to
    LISTSERV@YORKVM1 (LISTSERV%YORKVM.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
    for Internet users) with the one-line message:

iPSC <ipsclist@TCGOULD.TN.CORNELL.EDU>

   Mailing list to allow iPSC/1 and iPSC/2 users and systems administrators 
   from different installations to communicate easily and directly.

   Local aliases for this mailing list are to be handled by the local systems 
   administrators, since most sites already have local user mailing lists.  
   What is desired to accomplish is to link all these iPSC user lists 
   together.  The first thing needed is an administrator list and the user 
   list will hopefully follow.  If you are a system administrator for Intel 
   Hypercube(s) you are invited to send the following information to  
   ipsclist@TCGOULD.TN.CORNELL.EDU:

      - systems, iPSC/1's or iPSC/2's
      - administrator's e-mail address OR alias
      - institution
      - user alias list (might want this separate from existing
                         user list, a good idea)
      - suggestions, opinions, ideas....

   PLEASE! Systems Administrators Only.

   has some overlap with the ISODE list; contributors are urged to use the 
   appropriate list based on their topic of discussion.

ISO10646%JHUVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU
ISO10646 on LISTSERV@JHUVM

    Purpose:

    To serve as a clearing house for information on and discussion of
    multi-byte coded-character-set issues.

    The ISO 10646 draft and Unicode draft standards represent two
    different approaches to encoding the world's characters into a
    multi-byte code.

    Background:

    People are looking at multi-byte codes as a way to solve many of
    the problems we are experiencing with single-byte, 7-bit and 8-bit
    codes.  Although most of us do not need all 191 of the characters
    in the ISO 8859-1 character set (repertoire), we frequently need
    characters outside of this set; for example, bullets or nice
    quotation marks for professional looking documents, symbols for
    mathematics and science, etc.  The reason for developing
    multi-byte codes is that processing ONE multi-byte code appears
    easier than several single-byte codes.

    As of March, 1990, two coding schemes have emerged.  The
    International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Subcommittee
    2, Working Group 2 (SC2/WG2) has developed the ISO 10646
    Multi-Octet Code.  It is now a "draft proposed" standard (two
    levels removed from being an international standard).  The ISO
    working group has been working on this project for the last 6
    years and it has been subject to unusually wide review for a
    proposed standard.  The other draft standard is the result of the
    work of a consortium of U.S. companies, mostly from the west
    coast.  It is called Unicode.  Both of these draft standards
    enable the worlds communication (newspapers and magazines) and
    business characters, ideographs, and symbols to be encoded for
    storage and communication between computers.  However, each uses a
    different approach to making the inevitable tradeoffs.

    Mechanics:

    To subscribe send mail to  LISTSERV%JHUVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

ISODE@NIC.DDN.MIL

   Discussion group focusing on the ISO Development Environment, an openly 
   available implementation of some of the higher-level protocols adopted by 
   international organizations (ISO, CCITT, ECMA).  These implementations are 
   hosted on top of TCP/IP using the method discussed in RFC983.  Appropriate 
   topics are:

      - Questions about how to use ISODE (and announcements of ports to other
        target environments)
      - Discussion of ISODE as a part of a TCP/IP to ISO migration strategy
      - Exchange of ideas regarding ISO-based applications running in a native
        TCP/IP environment
      - Debate regarding where ISODE should go next

   The list naturally has some overlap with the TCP-IP list, the ISO list, and
   so on; contributors are urged to use the appropriate list based on their 
   topic of discussion.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to ISODE-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.

   ABOUT the KIDS-91 project
   -------------------------
   This non-profit project aims at getting as many 10-15 year old
   children as possible involved in a GLOBAL dialog continuing until May
   12th 1991.  We would like their responses to the following questions:

    1) Who am I?
    2) What do I want to be when I grow up?
    3) How do I want the world to be better when I grow up?
    4) What can I do now to make this happen?

   We also want the children to illustrate their future vision, for example
   in a drawing, a video tape, or something else.

   Exhibitions of selected parts of the responses will later be shipped back
   to the children of the world for them to see and enjoy.

LIBRES on LISTSERV@KENTVM  Library and Information Science Research
       or LISTSERV@KENTVM.KENT.EDU

   LIBRES is an electronic conference designed to foster library and
   information science research and support the development of our
   knowledge base.

   This forum will serve as a professional networking and information
   source.  We will share ideas, solutions and experiences.

   LIBRES will include discussions of research in progress, reviews of
   research, queries and responses from participants, and conference
   announcements.  LIBRES will be distributed weekly as editorial
   staffing allows.  All editors are volunteers on the LIBRES Project.

   Subscription is open to anyone interested.  All participants will be
   asked to submit a biography form before being added to the list.
   Completed biographies will be available on the LIBRES fileserver and
   via anonymous ftp from ksuvxa.kent.edu for review by LIBRES
   participants in order to facilitate identifying others with similar
   research interests.

   You may subscribe to LIBRES by sending a subscribe command by
   interactive message or by e-mail.  To subscribe by interactive
   message, send the command:
      SUB LIBRES YourFirstname YourLastname
   to LISTSERV@KENTVM.  For example:

   IBM VM CMS users would enter
        tell listserv at kentvm sub LIBRES YourFirstname YourLastname
   VAX VMS users would enter
        send listserv@kentvm sub LIBRES YourFirstname YourLastname

LINGUIST@UNIWA.UWA.OZ.AU   Linguistics and Related Fields

   A new list has been formed, which will serve as a place of discussion
   for those issues which concern the academic discipline of linguistics
   and related fields.  The list is international in orientation, and
   hopes to provide a forum for the community of linguists as they exist
   in different countries.  Though the list is moderated, and all
   submissions are subject to editorial discretion, it has no areal,
   ideological or theoretical bent, and discussion of any linguistic
   subfield are welcomed.  Membership of the list is open to all.

   To subscribe to this list, please send a message to
      LINGUIST-REQUEST@UNIWA.UWA.OZ.AU containing as its first and only
      line the following:

LIST OF MAILING LISTS

   Mailing-list for "List of lists" update notices.

   To keep people up to date on the large number of such lists, there is a 
   mailing-list for list-of-lists \update notices/.  Copies of the list itself
   are not sent to the world at large, but for those internet users who 
   seriously intend to copy the updated versions when updated, a brief notice 
   will be sent when a new version is available.

   An electronic mail server is available to copy the list to those who
   lack the IP internet. Send a message to mail-server@nisc.sri.com with
   a line "send netinfo/interest-groups" in the message body. For more
   information, use the line "send HELP" (Caps Matter).

lojban-list@snark.thyrsus.com


  This list is for exchange of information, ideas, comments, and text
  about the artificial language Lojban (also called Loglan) - reference
  Scientific American, June 1960.  This language has been recently completed
  after 35 years work, and is spoken by a few people, and growing
  steadily.  Its original purpose was as a tool in testing the Sapir-Whorf
  hypothesis of linguistics.  Other applications, including language
  education, machine translation, artificial intelligence, an international
  language, etc. have surfaced and gained adherents.

  For information about Lojban, send a snail address to:
  --  lojbab = Bob LeChevalier, President, The Logical Language Group, Inc.

  address folojban-list tra.   Send admin traffic anrequests to
  subscribe to

  The list is not formally moderated, though Bob LeChevalier and
  John Cowan (cowan@snark.thyrsus.com) tend to lead discussions.
  List maintenance is by Cowan and by snark-machine-host Eric Raymond, but
  these should be contacted through lojban-list-request per the above.

LWUsers%NDSUVM1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
LWUsers on LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 - FTP Software LANWatch Users

   LWUsers is an e-mail list to be used as a forum for technical
   discussions among users and developers of the LANWatch Local Area
   Network Analyzer for the IBM PC from FTP Software, Inc. While LANWatch
   has its roots in the MIT Netwatch program, it is different and the
   list is intended to focus on LANWatch.

   To subscribe, send the following command to LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu
   or LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.Bitnet in the BODY or TEXT of mail:

     SUB LWUSERS your_full_name

   where "your_full_name" is your name.  For example:

     SUB LWUSERS Im A. Packet

   Subscription is open to anyone, but list contributions are set up
   as "Private" which means that a user address MUST be on the list of
   subscribers in order to contribute.  This is ONLY done to cut down on
   stray "noise".  Anyone may subscribe to the list.  If you read the
   list on some other medium or want to contribute from a different mail
   address you may still do so.  Just subscribe as usual then send the
   command "set lwusers nomail" to LISTSERV to prevent it from sending
   you mail at that address.

   Once subscribed you may send contributions to
  LWUSERS@vm1.nodak.edu   or   LWUSERS@NDSUVM1 on BITNET.
  You should use the address corresponding to the LISTSERV address
  you used to subscribe.

   Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived.  You
   can obtain a list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX
   LWUSERS" to LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu or LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.Bitnet.  You
   may also access these archives via anonymous FTP on the Internet from
   host VM1.NoDak.EDU (CD LISTARCH and DIR LWUSERS.*).

MACPROG@WUVMD.WUSTL.EDU
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   Hosted by Washington University, the MACPROG list is the Internet
   answer to the excellent Usenet programming forum.  Hopefully the
   easier access of an Internet-based list will promote even better
   communication between Macintosh developers of commercial, in-house,
   and shareware software.  In addition, this list will move some of the
   more technical topics out from lists devoted to user-oriented issues.

   I will be moderating the list remotely from Wayne State University.
   I'm not a Mac programming expert per se.  But I am one of those
   sadistic indiviuals who, convinced life alone wasn't handing me
   enough problems, decided to take up Mac programming for the sheer fun
   of it.  Luckily I found a job where they'd pay me to have fun
   (actually I'm a System's Analyst but they give me in-house
   programming time for good behavior).

   The list will be moderated in a digest format (Info-mac style).  I'll
   collect submissions into one digest and crank one out every day or
   two as traffic dictates.  If the initial membership is any
   indication, this list should have heavy traffic.  30 people have
   subscribed already, with 40 more inquiries, without even having
   officially announced the list.

   The focus of MacProg will be to discuss mainstream language coding
   techniques.  What's a mainstream language?  C & Pascal principally,
   although other languages like LISP, Prologue, Fortran, Basic,
   HyperTalk, and application scripting are certainly welcome.  Besides
   Q&A, I'd like to have other features running.  For example, I'd like
   participants to report errors in documentation from Apple or other
   sources.  There's been times when I've felt like terminating
   execution of my program with a 16lb., chrome-plated sledge hammer,
   simply because of an error I was getting caused by errant
   specifications from Apple.  Also I'd like participants to offer quick
   reviews on books they've read, seminars they've attended, or
   interactive courses they've used which have been particularly good or
   bad.  Since no one can ever know everything about Mac programming,
   and since system compatibility is a constantly moving target, sources
   of programming information are important for beginners and experts
   alike.

   So, if you think you'd like to use this informative service for
   Macintosh developers send mail to
            LISTSERV@WUVMD.WUSTL.EDU   or   LISTSERV@WUVMD.BITNET
   with the following command in the BODY of the mail:
           SUBSCRIBE MACPROG your name

   Special thanks to Eric Oberle of Washington University for setting
   this all up on his mainframe.  But what do you mean when you say I
   have to pay the electric bill?

mac-security@eclectic.com  MacIntosh Security

   I have established a mailing list for people interested in Macintosh
   security.  This can be used to:

        * Discuss existing security problems in various Macintosh applications.
        * Discuss security applications, hardware, and solutions.
        * Discuss potential problems and their solutions.
        * Announcements of new Macintosh viruses and virus control software.
          (Discussion of viruses in depth should be carried out on
          virus specific mailing lists.)
        * Just about anything else related to Macintosh security and
          access control.

   With the arrival of System 7.0 and it's wealth of information sharing
   facilities, Macintosh security has entered a new era.  Originally you
   only had to worry about someone getting into your Macintosh via the
   keyboard, or stealing it outright.  Now it's much easier to browse
   through information on someone else's Macintosh over the network.

   If you're interested in joining the list, please send a message to:

        mac-security-request@eclectic.com

   Contributions to the list should go to:

        mac-security@eclectic.com

   At present, the list is unmoderated and will immediately distribute
   any incoming messages to the list.  If conditions change, the list
   will change to a moderated list, a digest, or some other form.  Also,
   we can look into making it a newsgroup at some point but I'd like to
   start it in this form and see what develops.

   welcome, from MACRO-32 syntax problems to VMS internals questions.

   This  list  was created to complement the discussions on INFO-VAX, which

MAIL-MEN@usl.com

   Mail-men is a moderated discussion group about men's issues and is open to 
   everyone.  The intent is to create an atmosphere of openess and 
   understanding for discussions about being male in today's world.  Flames 
   are best sent elsewhere.  Since men can't truly be free until women are, 
   feminism is generally viewed as a good thing on this list.  The list is 
   digested as a kindness to various mail systems.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

   to both end users and systems houses, but all should be able to cope with 
   the phrase Zilog Brain Damage with some degree of equanimity.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

   Discussions on all aspects related to the Interleaf publishing environment,
   including (but not restricted to) the Interleaf language, user environment,
   implementations on new platforms, user written enhancements, and filters, 
   bug reports and workarounds.

   On addressing users at Interleaf:

      ' Note that we have a registered domain in the uucp zone, and you can 
      find us in the uucp maps.  "user@ILEAF.COM" is equivalent to 
      "ileaf!user@EDDIE.MIT.EDU" (10 Canal Park), and "user@HQ.ILEAF.COM" is 
      equivalent to "leafusa!user@UUNET.UU.NET" (25 First Street).  Note that,
      at least in the hq.ileaf.com subdomain (of which I am one of the 
      administrators), you can mail to most users at Interleaf via a first 
      initial + last name alias (for example, I am reachable as

   shipboard LAN communications, plus ship-to-MARINE-L e-mail
   connectivity, general ship-to-mainland and international
   communications services, and the development of video telecourses for
   presentation via satellite, around the planet.  It is hoped that
   broad cooperation will enable this program to be able to offer a
   truly international selection of credit courses for a wide group of
   campuses, academics, researchers and students.

MEDSTU-L on LISTSERV@UNMVM   For Medical Students

   The University of New Mexico is pleased to announce that effective
   immediately, we are hosting a new Listserv discussion list for
   medical students worldwide.  The name of the new list is MEDSTU-L and
   initially, the list will be unmoderated with subscriptions open.  Due
   to a present limitation on disk storage, notebooks will be kept for a
   period of 30 days.

   The impetus for this list was mail I sent out several weeks ago
   soliciting medical students with e-mail accounts to exchange mail
   with medical students here.  As a result of that solicitation, I
   found that while there are many medical students with e-mail
   accounts, most of them are unaware of others with e-mail accounts.
   Thus, this list.  While it is an open list and therefore there is no
   way of verifying the subscription request, the two list owners
   respectfully request that the list be limited to students in medical
   schools.

   To subscribe to the list send e-mail to LISTSERV@UNMVM and in the
   body of the message say
   SUB MEDSTU-L your_first_name your_last_name

   If you have any questions, please let us know.

MHSnews@ICS.UCI.EDU
    mhsnews@SINTEF.NO  (from Europe)
    s=mhsnews; o=sintef; prmd=uninett; admd= ; c=no;

   This conference/mailing list is open to anyone who is seriously interested 
   in implementing the CCITT X.400 (MHS) message handling protocols.  The 
   conference/mailing list can discuss such things as how to understand and 
   interpret the MHS recommendations, how to map existing mail systems and 
   mail network features onto the MHS structure etc.

   MHS gateway discussions can be found in IFIP-GTWY@TIS.LLNL.GOV.

   To minimize international communications costs, distribution lists are 
   being maintained in Europe and North America.  European users should 
   contribute messages to mhsnews@SINTEF.NO (s=mhsnews; o=sintef; 
   prmd=uninett; admd= ; c=no;) and North American users should send messages 
   to MHSnews@ICS.UCI.EDU.  Messages sent to either list will be forwarded to 
   subscribers to the other lists.

   BITNET and NORTHNET subscribers will be served by a LISTSERV facility at 
   BYU in the USA.  EARN subscribers can be served from BYU, but we would 
   prefer EARN to be served by some site in Europe, if it can be arranged.

   USENET "subscribers" will be served by a Moderated feed to USENET with 
   "inet" distribution.  "Followup" contributions from USENET subscribers will
   be fed by the moderator into MHSnews@ICS.UCI.EDU.

   To subscribe to the conference:
      European users:
         Send a message to mhsnews-request@SINTEF.NO
         s=mhsnews-request; o=sintef; prmd=uninett; admd= ; c=no;

MIDEUR-L%UBVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list for discussion of Middle European politics, etc.

   An unmoderated list concerning the history, culture, politics and
   current affairs of those countries lying between the Mediterranean/
   Adriatic and the Baltic Seas, and between the German/Austrian borders
   and the Soviet Union.  The emphasis is particularly on the
   nationalities policies of these countries, their economic development,
   their possible union or disunion, and their place in a united Europe.
   Cross-posting with lists concerning West Europe/ Germany and the USSR
   is encouraged where the topics bear directly on Middle Europe.

   It is presumed that the bulk of the discussions will be on serious
   current or past events, treated in a scholarly manner.  However, there
   is no set policy and personal observations, advice-seeking, and gossip
   are not ruled out.

   BitNet users may subscribe by sending the following command to 
   LISTSERV@UBVM via interactive message or e-mail:
      SUB MIDEUR-L Your full name
   where "Your full name" is your real name, not your login Id.

   current revenue shortage and it's effect on education, that may well
   be a popular topic.

   it's up to the participants.

   understanding among those who work in museums.  It is also hoped that
   the discussion can share ideas and information regarding new methods
   of interpreting information for visitors, both high tech and low
   tech.

   To subscribe, send a one line message to LISTSERV@UNMVM.BITNET:

music-research%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSS.CS.UCL.AC.UK

   The Music-Research electronic mail redistribution list was established 
   after a suggestion made at a meeting in Oxford in July 1986, to provide an 
   effective and fast means of bringing together musicologists, music 
   analysts, computer scientists, and others working on applications of 
   computers in music research.  Initially, the list was established for 
   people whose chief interests concern computers and their applications to

      - music representation systems
      - information retrieval systems for musical scores
      - music printing
      - music analysis
      - musicology and ethnomusicology
      - tertiary music education
      - databases of musical information

   The following areas are NOT the principal concern of this list, although 
   overlapping subjects may well be interesting:

      - primary and secondary education
      - sound generation techniques
      - composition

   This group is gatewayed to the USENET group "comp.music", but postings to 
   comp.music are not included in the digest.

   On-line archives are not yet available, but copies will be mailed on 
   request by Brad Rubenstein <bradr@INGRES.BERKELEY.EDU>.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to 
   music-research-request%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSS.CS.UCL.AC.UK or UUCP  
   ...!ukc!ox-prg!music-research-request.

NAC@VM1.NODAK.EDU
NAC@NDSUVM1.BITNET

   The "NAC" list is a BITNET/NetNorth/EARN Redistribution list for Usenet 
   Newsgroup news.announce.conferences. "news.announce.conferences" is used to
   post calls for papers and conference announcements.  Contributions should 
   be submitted to mcmi!news-announce-conferences@uunet.uu.net,  
   news-announce-conferences@mcmi.uucp, NAC@VM1.NODAK.EDU.,or 
   NAC@NDSUVM1.BITNET (the list is MODERATED.  Submissions to NAC@NDSUVM1 
   (NAC@VM1.NODAK.EDU) will be forwarded to the Moderator).

   Contributions sent to the list are automatically archived.  You can obtain 
   a list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX NAC" command to 
   LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 or LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU.  These files can then be 
   retrieved by means of a "GET NAC filetype" command, or using the database 
   search facilities of LISTSERV.  Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for more 
   information on the latter.  The command may be in the BODY or TEXT of the 
   mail, NOT the subject, or may be sent interactively via TELL or SEND on 
   BitNet/EARN/NetNorth.

   You may also obtain copies of the list notebooks via anonymous FTP to 
   VM1.NODAK.EDU (192.33.18.30), userid ANONYMOUS, any password.  Once 
   validated do a CD LISTARCH and DIR NAC.* to see the notebooks available.  
   The file system is NOT hierarchical so you must do a CD ANONYMOUS if you 
   want to return to the "root".

   You may subscribe to NAC by sending the command:
      SUB NAC Your_full_name      (eg. SUB NAC Jane Doe)
   to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 or LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

NAMEDROPPERS@NIC.DDN.MIL

   The NAMEDROPPERS mailing list is to be used for discussion of the concepts,
   principles, design, and implementation of the domain style names.  The main
   focus of this group is the review of documents describing domain style 
   names.  This is a list for participants in a discussion, not observers.  
   Everyone on the list is expected to contribute from time to time.

   Nearly everyone in NAMEDROPPERS is also on HEADER-PEOPLE and also on 
   MSGGROUP.  There is no need to send a message to both NAMEDROPPERS and 
   either of these lists (and certianly not both!).

   All of the previous NAMEDROPPERS discussion can be found in NIC.DDN.MIL 
   files
      NAMEDROPPERS:NAMEDROPPERS.yymmdd
   For certain years, the whole archive fits in a single file; those files 
   will only have a yy extension.  These files can be accessed via anonymous 
   FTP; new members may wish to copy and read these archives before joining 
   the discussion.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to NAMEDROPPERS-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.

NetMonth

   NetMonth is a network service publication distributed free of charge to 
   students and professionals in BITNET and other networks.  This magazine and
   it's companion file, BITNET SERVERS, are the work of the Yale Computer 
   Center BITNET Services Library (BITLIB) staff.  The BITLIB is a local 
   online help facility designed to inform Yale network users about what 
   services are available to them through BITNET, and provide instructions and
   utilities for their proper use.  In publishing NetMonth the BITLIB staff 
   members hope to share the fruits of their labor with institutions outside 
   of Yale in order to promote a productive and enjoyable networking 
   environment for everyone.  The BITLIB system is now distributed to more 
   than thirty educational institutions worldwide.

NEWEDU-L on LISTSERV@USCVM.BITNET    New Paradigms in Education List
         or LISTSERV@VM.USC.EDU
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   This list is dedicated to experimenting with and exploring the way we
   educate.  We ask: what are the new paradigms in education and how can
   they be implemented.

   For instance:

     * How is technology changing the way we view education?
     * What effects will cooperative/collaborative strategies have
       on teaching and learning?
     * Does the so-called "information age" change the way we view
       our responsibilities as educators?
     * Artificial intelligence research is changing our view of
       how we know things.  How does this affect education?
     * How can we reduce dependency in education and foster
       independent learning?

   There are many individuals working in these areas, each with a
   conviction that education will change.  This list attempts to bring
   together every teacher, student, researcher, librarian, multimedia
   expert and information specialist interested in educational change --
   Kindergarten through post-graduate.

   You are encouraged to:

     * Submit summaries of or commentary on published articles and books
       which explore the frontiers of teaching and learning.
     * Submit in-progress papers or abstracts of those papers for
       comment.
     * Share the results of your experiments with teaching and
       learning.
     * Ask thought-provoking questions about the future of
       education and the environments in which it takes place.
     * Recruit interested parties to this listserv, regardless of
       their status in education, industry or government.

   Subscribing to NEWEDU-L:

   IBM VM users in BITNET may add themselves to the mailing list with

NEW-LIST@VM1.NODAK.EDU
	NEW-LIST@NDSUVM1.BITNET

   The "NEW-LIST" list has been established as a central address to post 
   announcements of new public mailing lists.  In addition, "NEW-LIST" might 
   be used as a final verification before establishing a list (to check for 
   existing lists on the same topic, etc.).  However, be sure to check sources
   such as the Internet List-of-Lists (SIGLIST or INTEREST-GROUPS list), 
   LISTSERV GROUPS, Usenet News newusers lists, and the LISTS database on the 
   major LISTSERVs (we have the LISTS database on NDSUVM1).

   It is not our intent to replace the various lists of lists that are 
   available.  We want to provide a clearinghouse to feed list announcements 
   to all those maintaining the lists and others who are interested.

   You may subscribe to the NEW-LIST list by sending RFC822 Mail to 
   LISTSERV@VM1.NoDak.EDU on Internet or LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 on BitNet.  In the 
   BODY (text) of your mail include the command:
      SUB NEW-LIST firstname lastname
   eg.  sub new-list Jane Doe
   The LISTSERV server will take your address from the "From:" address of your
   mail.  If you are on BITNET/EARN/NetNorth and can send interactive messages
   (eg.  TELL on CMS or SEND on VMS with JNET) then you can send the SUB 
   command as shown to LISTSERV at NDSUVM1 interactively.

   If you prefer, you may send mail to the Coordinator to be asked to be added
   to the list.  However you subscribe, you should receive return mail with a 
   confirmation and additional information.

   is an extensible multitasking window system environment, consisting of a 
   network based display server that is controlled and programmed in 
   PostScript, Adobe's page description language.  NeWS was designed to be a 
   portable, device independent window system development platform that runs 
   on a wide range of hardware, in a distributed heterogeneous environment.

   The archives are available via anonymous FTP from BRILLIG.UMD.EDU, in the

next-managers@stolaf.edu
	[Last Updated 28-January-1992]
 
   This list is intended to be a quick-turnaround trouble shooting aid
   for those who administer and manage NeXT systems.  Its primary purpose
   is to provide the NeXT manager with a quick source of information for
   system management problems that are of a time-critical nature.
   Its secondary purpose is to disseminate time-critical or security-
   related information.
 
   To be added to the list send mail to the owner (below).
 
   Owner:  next-managers-request@stolaf.edu
 
 
   ----- CUT HERE FOR NEXT-MANAGERS POLICY -----
 
   EVERYONE WHO RECEIVES THIS MESSAGE: READ IT THOROUGHLY.
 
   This message is a summary of the next-managers charter and rules.
   Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in severe
   chastisement by the list maintainer and other list participants
   or your being removed from the next-managers mailing list.
 
 
   1:  This list is NOT moderated!  Every message that is sent to the list
                   next-managers@stolaf.edu
       will be passed on to every member of the list
 
   2:  Requests to have addresses added or removed from the list should NOT
       be sent to the entire list.  Instead, they should be mailed to:
                   next-managers-request@stolaf.edu
 
   3:  This list is intended to be a quick-turnaround trouble shooting aid
       for those who administer and manage NeXT systems.  Its primary purpose
       is to provide the NeXT manager with a quick source of information for
       system management problems that are of a time-critical nature.
       Its secondary purpose is to disseminate time-critical or security-
       related information.
 
   4:  Answers to questions are to be mailed back to the questioner and are
       NOT to be sent to the entire list.  The person who originally asked
       the question has the responsibility of summarizing the answers and
       sending the entire summary back to the list.  If everyone follows
       this, one problem will only generate two or possibly three messages
       on the list.  The summary message should contain the keyword "SUMMARY"
       in the subject line.
 
   5:  Corrections to compiled answers should be addressed only to the
       person who first asked the question; this person (the writer of
       the original question) is then responsible for distributing
       the corrected information to the list.
 
   6:  Discussions on ANY topic are very strongly discouraged.
 
   7:  If it is not specifically related to NeXT system management, then it
       does NOT belong on this list.
 
   8:  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...Think before you send a message!  Ask yourself
       is this really appropriate?
           have you checked in the reference manuals?
           have you checked NextAnswers?
           have you checked the Digital Librarian?
           have you checked in the online man pages?
           have you checked the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list?
           have you checked the next-managers archive?
       before mailing to the next-managers list. There are enough
       other newsgroups, mailing lists and other resources around
       to cover the marginal topics.
 
   9:  Do NOT send message from "root" or from "me"; send them from
       your own personal account.
 
   10: Do not send messages with NeXT attachments; please use straight-text
       only.
 
   11: next-managers is currently archived on "ftp.stolaf.edu" in

   This list is in some sense a spin-off of the AIList, and as such, a certain
   amount of overlap is expected.  The primary concentration of this list 
   should be NL and KR, that is, natural language (be it understanding, 
   generation, recognition, parsing, semantics, pragmatics, etc.) and how we 
   should represent knowledge (aquisition, access, completeness, etc. are all 
   valid issues).  Topics deemed to be outside the general scope of this list 
   will be forwarded to AIList (or other more appropriate list) or rejected.  
   Readers are warned not to submit any information that is export-controlled 
   or classified.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to NL-KR-REQUEST@cs.rpi.edu.

NORTHSTAR-USERS@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   Discussion group for Northstar microcomputer users.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   NORTHSTAR-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to NORTHSTAR-USERS-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   love all sorts of operas ? Do you think that Mozart wrote "Il Barbiere
   di Siviglia" and Rossini "Le Nozze di Figaro", because you were told
   that "Figaro ca', Figaro... " is by Rossini ? Or are you an expert on
   Caron de Beaumarchais' contributions to everything - from philosophy to
   poetry to the American revolution - and to the music of Mozart ?
     Do you unabashedly love Beethoven's "Fidelio" ? (You must be a real

   possible topics (but not limited to):

   Operator Training (or lack of - as is too often the case in some
   installations).

   Tips on operating the various computer systems and I/O gear.  Those
    helps and hints that could be shared by veteran operators to aid
   new operators in their learning process.  Those hints that are not
   in the documentation to make an operators job a little easier!

   Software packages available to help day to day computer operations
   such as job scheduling, disk and tape management etc.

   Problems caused by working night shift, weekends and holidays.

   Education and career advancement issues.

   Overcoming boredom - many operators get locked in to the same old
   same old day after day.

   War stories about hardware and software problems.  What products to
   avoid under certain conditions.

   Health concerns - Eye strain and related VDT concerns.  Carpel
   tunnel problems.

   Pros and cons on shift rotation vs. permanent shifts.

   An 'I told you so' column - how many times does management say how to
   operations staff is going to do something and the operators try to
   give their input (which is rarely heard!).

   Humor - Funny stories about those instances where you just gotta
   laugh.  You got to have a sense of humor to be in our line of work!

Pol-Econ@SHSU.BITNET

   Pol-Econ is a new list to provide an unmoderated environment where
   issues, questions, comments, ideas, and uses of Political Economy as
   a logical framework can be discussed.  In a broad sense, this
   includes virtually anything dealing with economics.

   The explicit purpose of Pol-Econ is to provide timely interchange
   between subscribers, to provide a forum where interesting questions
   can be addressed within the context of interactive exchange between
   many individuals, to discuss the evolution and application of
   Political Economy, to announce professional meetings, calls for
   papers, etc., and to provide partial tables of contents for current
   periodicals.  As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the discussion
   and topics are only limited by the participation and interest of its
   subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an active role by
   posting to Pol-Econ or an inactive role by monitoring the list.
   Although not necessary for participation, it shall be assumed that
   subscribers are basically familiar with technical economic jargon.

   To subscribe to Pol-Econ, please send a MAIL message to:
             LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET          ----
   The body of this MAIL message should be one line and contain the words:
   SUBSCRIBE Pol-Econ
                             ******Please note******
   LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET is not supported by the conventional interactive
   VM-based LISTSERV, but is instead entirely MAIL oriented.

POLAND-L%UBVMS.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list devoted to the discussion of Polish culture and events.  We 
   are interested in all subjects related to Poland, Polish Americans and 
   Eastern Europe (related to Poland).

   POLAND-L is archived weekly.  To obtain a list of available files send the 
   following command to LISTSERV@UBVM through e-mail: INDEX POLAND-L

   To subscribe to POLAND-L, send the following command to LISTSERV@UBVM via 
   e-mail text:
      SUBSCRIBE POLAND-L Your_full_name
   where "Your_full_name" is your real name, not your login Id.  We discourage
   using SEND or similar means, since this sometimes introduces different 
   paths than e-mail and may result in bouncing e-mail.
   Non-BitNet users can join by sending the above command as the only line in 
   the text/body of a message to LISTSERV%UBVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

POLI-SCI@RUTGERS.EDU

   POLI-SCI is a spinoff from the HUMAN-NETS discussion list.  Shortly after 
   the November 1980 election, HUMAN-NETS began to discuss the impact that 
   electronic communications had on the election.  As this discussion 
   continued, it lost its narrow focus on electronic communications and began 
   to consider the election in general, how elections are won and lost, and 
   the nature of the electoral college.  The growth of these discussions, and 
   their spawning of related discussions, indicated that a separate discussion
   list was merited and POLI-SCI was installed.  Since then POLI-SCI has begun
   to consider other topics including the history of the Carter and Nixon 
   presidencies, the Iranian hostage crisis, etc. (with a little less dignity,
   the list might be characterized as a permanent distributed political bull 
   session).

   Archived digest messages are stored on RUTGERS in:
      <poli-sci>mail.txt
      and other files in the <poli-sci> directory

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to POLI-SCI-REQUEST@RUTGERS.EDU.

POPULATION-BIOLOGY <biosci%NET.BIO.NET@VM1.NODAK.EDU>

   Population Biology is a synthesis of population ecology and population 
   genetics, pursuing a unified theory to explain the structure, functioning 
   and evolution of populations of living beings.  Such populations are very 
   complex systems, exhibiting a variety of phenomena that we stil do not 
   master.  Just to quote a famous example, multiannual density cycles (e.g. 
   in lemmings) have not received a satisfactory expalnation, despite of 
   decades of debated studies and speculations.  Population Biology is a very 
   active field, encompassing such diverse approaches as tenacious, harsh 
   field work to track long term demographic and genetic fluctuations, or 
   sophisticated conversations with a computer about strange attractors 
   possibly causing chaos in the density fluctuations.

   Topics that can be discussed include: ecology, population genetics, 
   systematics, evolution, morphometry, interspecific competition, 
   sociobiology, mathematical modelling, population regulation, pest control, 
   speciation, chromosomal evolution, social behaviour, statistical 
   methodology in population study, population management of endangered 
   species, applications of molecular biology techniques, etc., and, last but 
   not least, your own topic.  There is no restriction on the species: 
   viruses, protokaryotes, plants, animals (including man), mythic or extinct 
   species, computer- simulated species...  Technical problems, book reviews, 
   meeting annoucements and so on are also welcome.

   The BITNET and USENET names of the new group are:

PROLOG[-HACKERS]@SUSHI.STANFORD.EDU

   Prolog and logic programming mailing lists.

   Some of the people answering the initial BBoard message stated that they 
   would be interested in general Prolog and logic programming information, 
   but not in the nitty-gritty details of Prolog systems and their bugs. 
   Therefore, two mailing lists have been set up, PROLOG and PROLOG-HACKERS: 
   PROLOG will provide a digest of articles of general interest; 
   PROLOG-HACKERS will provide a direct mailing for the nasty stuff.  Finally,
   PROLOG-REQUEST should be used for distribution requests.  In a nutshell:

      Mail to                            for
      -------                            ---

PSRT-L on LISTSERV@UMCVMB  Political Science Research and Teaching

   PSRT-L@UMCVMB is a moderated discussion list on Bitnet which deals
   with issues of interest to professional political scientists, both
   researchers and teachers.  Submissions from all sub-fields of
   political science as well as related disciplines are encouraged.

   The list is not intended to serve as a public forum for debate over
   current issues in politics, as other lists already fill that niche.
   Rather it is intended to provide an opportunity for political
   scientists to present their ideas and ongoing research for
   discussion, to consider the directions in which the discipline is
   advancing, and to encourage the dissemination of new concepts in
   research and teaching.  In addition to ongoing discussions, the list
   editors would like to post announcements of job openings and upcoming
   conferences.

   To subscribe to PSRT-L send mail to  LISTSERV@UMCVMB on BITNET with
   the TEXT or BODY of the mail containing the one line:

PSYCGRAD@ACADVM1.UOTTAWA.CA
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

          Psychology Graduate Students Discussion Group List

   Now graduate students of psychology can communicate among each other
   efficiently and free of charge because, there is a new list on the
   Listserv called PSYCGRAD (Psychology Graduate Students Discussion
   Group List).  Its main purpose is to provide a medium through which
   graduate students in the field of psychology can communicate.

   If you are a student studying in a graduate-level psychology program,
   you are invited to join this list.  It is asked that conversation
   topics be relevant to being a graduate student in psychology.  As you
   probably can see, this is a very open category and not too rigorously
   defined.  Virtually, anything goes except junk-mail advertisements.
   The list will not be moderated and subscriptions are open.  (Junk
   mail has been a terrible problem for many users in the past).
   Corporations, businesses, agencies, publishers, etc.  are not invited
   to the list.

   There are a few ways to subscribe to this list.

   1. If your system is part of Bitnet and a VM system, you may do this
   by using the interactive command by typing at the R; (prompt)-
   TELL LISTSERV AT UOTTAWA SUB PSYCGRAD Yourfirstname Yourlastname
   (Don't forget to capitalize and lower case Yourfirstname and Yourlastname).

   2. If your system is part of Bitnet and a VAX system, you may do this
   by using the interactive command by typing this comand.
   SEND LISTSERV@ACADVM1.UOTTAWA.CA SUB PSYCGRAD Yourfirstname Yourlastname
   (Don't forget to capitalize and lower case Yourfirstname and
   Yourlastname).

   3. Or, you may mail one single solitary command to Listserv by
   mailing to LISTSERV AT UOTTAWA, and then make your only line read as
   follows...
      SUB PSYCGRAD Yourfirstname Yourlastname.

   4. If your system is part of Internet you may mail the same command,
   as outlined in #3, to LISTSERV@ACADVM1.UOTTAWA.CA

pubnet@chinacat.unicom.com

   A new mailing list has been formed to discuss public access UNIX
   systems.  It's primarily focus is upon starting and administering
   such a system, but users are certainly welcome to join in.

   The backbone of the "pubnet" hierarchy no longer exists, and along
   with it went the main purpose for these newsgroups.  Even though
   pubnet is no longer needed, it still serves two important functions.
   First, it is the home for Phil Eschallier's "nixpub" list of public
   access systems.  Second, it offers a forum for the administrators of
   public access systems.

   Nixpub won't be lost in the changes.  It is already cross-posted into
   comp.misc, and I expect Phil will make that its new home.

   The second function, however, will be lost when pubnet goes away.  I
   floated a trial balloon to see if there was interest in creating a
   single newsgroup (I suggested "comp.org.pubnet") to replace the
   pubnet hierarchy.  The response I received was favorable, but not
   enough to support creating a group.

   Thus - I propose a "pubnet" mailing list to fill in this gap.  If you
   want to join, send a request to "pubnet-request@chinacat.unicom.com".

   Why do I care that pubnet survives?  Neither me nor my equipment has
   anything to do with public access systems.  Call it a debt of
   gratitude.  Four years ago, when I moved from California to Texas, my
   USENET and email access was lost.  Thanks to folks like Wayne Ross
   (then of warble, and previous keeper of the nixpub) and Charlie
   Boykin (then of killer) I was able to get access and eventually
   bootstap a USENET site.  Public access UNIX provides some good
   services, and it's a worthwhile thing to keep around.  (Now...if this
   was a pitch for public television I'd next implore you to dig deeply
   into your pockets...  :-)

PURTOPOI on LISTSERV@PURCCVM

            Purdue Rhetoric, Professional Writing, and
                    Language Discussion Group

   The PURTOPOI list is a scholarly forum for the discussion of current
   issues or "topoi" in the fields of rhetoric and composition,
   professional writing, and language research.  While the list began
   as a list for Purdue only, it became so popular that it has been
   opened up for general subscriptions.

   Previous topics taken up by the group have included:

   -    the relationship between social construction and ethnographic
        research in composition.

   -    the disciplinary relationships between rhetoric, literary
        criticism, and linguistics.

   -    the debate between agonistic and rogerian approaches to
        composition.

   -    the impact of cultural studies on composition pedagogy and
        research.

   -    and the antagonism between post-structuralist and cognitivist
        approaches to historical, theoretical, and empirical research
        methods.

   Members are encouraged to submit works in progress, reviews of recent
   publications, reports or announcements of conferences,
   bibliographies, or questions for group discussion.

   Subscription to the list is by listowners.  Messages sent to the list
   are archived and may be retrieved by list members.  Also, a filelist
   containing help files, bibliographies, and papers of interest is
   available to list members.

ripe-map@nic.eu.net
	[Last Updated 28-January-1992]

   This is an announcement of a new mailing list for discussing
   the issues involved in mapping and visualising computer
   networks.

   With the growth in complexity of computer networks, mapping is
   becoming more important as a visualisation technique and for
   finding anomalies.  There are numerous commericial and public
   domain tools available but many have serious limitations and
   are often specific to a single group of protocols.
   
   RIPE (Reseau IP Europeen) has set up a working group for studying
   the problem, this mailing list is intended as a forum for wider
   discussions.

   To join, send mail to      <ripe-map-request@nic.eu.net>
   to contribute send mail to <ripe-map@nic.eu.net>
   archives on mcsun.eu.net:~ftp/ripe/archives/ripe-map
   Some of the issues for discussion are listed here,

   Auto-discovery,
	automatically discovering the topology of computer networks.
	How can this be done, what standards need changing to do this
	efficiently.

  Automatic Layout,
	Automatically laying out (or untangling) maps so that they look
	good on in a window or on a piece of paper.  

   Features,
	which feaures of existing tools are the best what else is wanted.

   Formats,
	in what format should maps be stored and how should they be
	distributed.

   Model,
	What database model should be used.  Should it	be concerned
	purely with the graphic represention or should it try to model
	the underlying networks. Different types of map suitable for
	different purposes, what are the catagories.

   Other Tools and Standards,
	how can existing tools and protocols be tied in with a mapping
	database.

   Symbols,
	Standard symbols for representing network entities.
	How should the status of such entities be drawn.




Right_Use_of_Will@kether.webo.dg.com
			or	will@kether.webo.dg.com
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   This mailing list is for people interested in discussing topics
   related to the series of books by Ceanne DeRohan, the first of which
   is called The Right Use of Will, Healing and Evolving the Emotional Body.

   These are not ordinary self-help books that show you how to change your 
   life; these books can help you save it.

   The understandings given in these four books were received from God in 
   the first person.  They are are first so startling, so unlike anything you 
   would expect to hear, that you are apt to become very angry, or flatly 
   incredulous.  These understandings have to do with the split that has 
   occurred in each of us between Spirit (male intellect), and Will (female 
   feelings): how this split occurred, and why it has to be healed now, and 
   to go about it.  These are not easy books to read, or to fully 
   understand at first reading.  But they are very worth your while.

   When you have completed the series, you will have some understanding of 
   how the Cosmos came into being, who the four parts of the One God are, 
   who Lucifer is, who the created spirits are and how, why, and when they 
   emerged, where you emerged, what went wrong from the very beginning, the 
   roles played by denial, blame, and guilt, why we and the entire creation, 
   including God, are in peril, and whether you want to heal and remain 
   within God, or not.

   Individuals interested in the concepts of Will, emotional healing,
   Earth's and Creation's current evolutionary track, and the healing of
   the Divine Feminine and Masculine (within and without) are encouraged
   to read the books and join in on the discussion.
 
   The service address, to which questions about the list itself and requests
   to be added to or deleted from it should be directed, are as follows:
 
	Will-Request@kether.webo.dg.com

    You can send mail to the entire list via one of these addresses:

   RusTeX-L was started in September 1989 to facilitate the work on the 
   Russian language version of the TeX typesetting system, but related 
   technical topics are often discussed on the list: other Russian text 
   processing systems, thesauri, spell checkers, Russian keyboard layout, and 
   e-mail to Soviet sites.  This list is limited to technical topics only: any
   articles of political nature (including the discussion of COCOM 
   restrictions on technology transfers) should be directed to another list or
   newsgroup (e.g., talk.politics.soviet).

   A collection of RusTeX-related software (METAFONT sources for Cyrillic 
   fonts, Russian hyphenation patterns, et al) and mailing list archives are 
   kept on UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU.

SCUG-G on LISTSERV@DGOGWDG1 Systems Center User Group - German
SCUG-G on LISTSERV@IBM.GWDG.DE (Internet)

   Since foundation of list L-VMCTR@AKRONVM we revealed some problems
   that could not be discussed in this list, because they are specially
   related to our situation in the middle of Europe.  Therefore we set
   up a new list, called SCUG-G (Systems Center User Group - German),
   which is located at Goettingen (DGOGWDG1.BITNET), Germany.

   This new list is concerned to all software components of VMCENTER,
   VMCENTER II and to VMSPOOL of Systems Center, Inc., Reston.  Topics
   we want to discuss are:

      legal aspects of Systems Center software
      COCOM restrictions
      difficulties caused by the technical support in Frankfurt/Main et al.
      price policy problems (which usually occur 1 year later than in USA)
      announcements of the german Systems Center User Group

   There is no intention to compete with L-VMCTR.  Discussion language
   should be German.

   To subscribe, send request to LISTSERV@DGOGWDG1.BITNET using the
   following message text:

      SUB SCUG-G your name

SECURITY@AIM.RUTGERS.EDU

   This list is designed to provide a forum for discussion of the field of 
   security in general, be it electronic, physical, or computer-related.  
   Since the original idea was to name this list LOCKSMITHS, discussions about
   physical security and hardware are welcomed, but to broaden out into 
   computer security and electronic access control and such is also fine.  In 
   other words, any subject matter relating to the *improvement* and 
   *implementation* of security systems is okay, while how to *defeat* them is
   not.  Messages are moderated to keep things of questionable legality or 
   content from escaping out to the network.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to SECURITY-REQUEST@AIM.RUTGERS.EDU.

   There is a BitNet sub-distribution list, SECURITY@UGA; BitNet subscribers 
   can join by sending the SUB command with your name.  For example:
      SEND LISTSERV@UGA SUB SECURITY Jon Doe

SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS.EDU

        SF-LOVERS has discussed many topics, all of them related in some way
   to the theme of science fiction or fantasy.  The topics have ranged very
   widely from rewritten stories, SF and fantasy books, SF movies, and SF
   conventions to reviews of books, movies and television shows.  The range of
   topics is quite wide and anyone is welcome to submit material on these or
   other topics of interest in this general area.

     The digest has a very large number of readers, and trivial messages
   are strongly discouraged due to the heavy load SF-LOVERS puts on the hosts
   CPU and disk space.  Messages to SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS.EDU are batched and
   broadcast periodically.

     The SF-LOVERS archives are available via anonymous ftp on
   ELBERETH.RUTGERS.EDU, a unix machine running BSD 4.3.  Each volume is
   contained in its own file, with the contents ordered chronologically.  The
   first archive includes a number of messages from the early days before
   digests and there is much of "historical" interest.

  /u2/ftp/pub/sfl:
   2128 sf-lovers.v1

   7568 sf-lovers.v14b
   4352 sf-lovers.v15a
   3456 sf-lovers.v15b

     For those unfamiliar with unix, the number to the left of the file
   name is the size of the file in kilobytes.
     Volume 16 is the current volume.  Old issues for the current volume
   are also available from the archives in the files sf-lovers.xxxyy where
   "xxx" is the month of publication and "yy" is the current year.  BITNET
   subscribers who currently do not have access to anonymous ftp may send
   mail to BITFTP@PUCC.BITNET with ftp commands as text of the mail message.
   Further instructions are available on request.

     Also in the archives are some files that may be of interest including
   episode guides for popular television shows.  A partial list as of (May 1
   1991) is:

   Episode guides:
      20 blakes7.guide

   network which links universities and corporations throughout the world.
   Internet is easy to use and in many cases free of cost. Our operating costs
   for this network are minimal as should be yours.

   SGANet is easy to use and will be the host of many interesting discussions
   which will be of great interest to your organization. SGANet is open to any
   student government association at any university worldwide.

   SGANet is an automated mailing list located at Virginia Tech. Let's say,
   for example, that a student government association from a university in
   Australia wants to share some of the issues it is working on. They would
   simply write their article and send it via mail to one of the
   addresses above SGANet then receives their mail and sends copies of it
   to every organization on the list. There is no limit to mail usage,
   and any one on the list can submit an article for distribution. It's
   that simple and it's very low in cost, in many cases FREE.

    To become a member of SGANet:

    Send the following message to LISTSERV%VTMV1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU:

   subscribe SGANet (Your organization's full name)

   {You will receive acknolwedgement and instructions upon receipt of
    your subscription}

   Send articles, comments, anecdotes, etc. to SGANet@VTVM1.BITNET
   They will be automatically sent to everyone on the list. This allows
   for really good interactive discussions.

SHAKSPER on LISTSERV@UTORONTO International Shakespeare Conference

   Since its initial announcement this past summer, the International
   Electronic Shakespeare Conference, SHAKSPER, has grown steadily and
   moved in new and exciting directions.  I would like to take this
   opportunity to describe some of the changes in SHAKSPER, and to
   invite those who might have missed the initial announcement to join
   us.
   SHAKSPER is a scholarly BITNET seminar modelled on HUMANIST,
   currently involving more than ninety Shakespearean researchers,
   instructors, students, and interested amateurs from seven countries.
   A number of national and international Shakespeare organizations have
   expressed an interest in formal involvement, and a number of
   traditional journals have announced it to their readership.

   The SHAKSPER Fileserver offers conference papers and abstracts, an
   Index to Scholarly Works in Progress, an International Directory of
   Shakespeare Institutes, a Directory of Shakespearean Conferences and
   Calls for Papers, biographies of conference members, and reference
   files on a wide variety of subjects.  Members of a number of seminars
   at the upcoming SAA Conference in Vancouver will find their
   colleagues ready to share papers, comments, and strategies in
   advance.  SHAKSPEReans also gain indirect access to the SHAKSPER
   Quarto/Folio Textbase, a 17-megabyte textbase of all 55 authoritative
   quarto and folio texts of the 38 plays.

   The daily SHAKSPER digests offer an opportunity for informal
   discussion, eavesdropping, peer review, and a fresh sense of
   worldwide community.  Conference announcements, Shakespeare
   Association bulletins, member notes and queries, book and theatre
   reviews, textual debate, discussion of lecture strategies -- SHAKSPER
   has already logged all this and much more.

   No academic qualifications are required for membership in SHAKSPER,
   and anyone interested in English Literature, the Renaissance, or
   Drama is welcome to join us.  Write to the editor, Ken Steele
   <KSTEELE@vm.epas.utoronto.ca>, or send the command
         SUB SHAKSPER firstname lastname
   to LISTSERV@UTORONTO in the body of mail or via an interactive
   message such as
         TELL LISTSERV AT UTORONTO SUB SHAKSPER firstname lastname
   and you will receive a more detailed information file with further
   instructions for becoming a SHAKSPERean.  (SHAKSPER is not open to
   automatic subscription, but no one is refused.)

   Editor:  Ken Steele  <KSTEELE@vm.epas.utoronto.ca>

   (Please consider forwarding this announcement to
   colleagues who might be interested, whether or not they
   are currently using Bitnet, or posting a paper copy in
   your English or Drama department.)



SHOGI-L%TECHNION.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
SHOGI-L on LISTSERV@TECHNION



   SHOGI-L, the Shogi Discussion List, is a new mailing list started on
   May 6, 1990 about the strategic board game of Shogi. The list is intended
   to serve as a discussion point for Shogi-related topics and as a source of
   information about Shogi tactics and Shogi events. It also offers to Shogi
   players the possibility to engage in e-mail games in a friendly ladder
   competition.

   Shogi is much like 'western' chess, but has some very interesting
   differences.  One is that almost all pieces can promote to stronger
   pieces once they reach the opposite side of the board. The second very
   important difference is that when a piece is captured, it becomes a
   piece for the capturing side, and can be dropped back onto the board !
   This makes for a very exciting game, with an extremely low percentage
   of draws. Many strong Chess players, such as International Master
   Larry Kaufman in the US (who is the strongest non-Japanese player
   outside Japan), have found Shogi to be a great game to play.

   Although played by millions in Japan, so far it isn't well known outside
   Japan. But surely, there are some net-people out there who would
   like to play or get to know more about it. For Apple Macintosh owners
   we also have a Hypercard Shogi Stack available, which contains
   valuable information for every Shogi novice. We would also like to get
   source or executable code for a program that plays Shogi.

   How to subscribe:

   participation is welcomed and solicited.

   Subscription is open to anyone interested.

   You may subscribe to SMS-SNUG by sending a subscribe command by
   interactive message or by e-mail.  To subscribe by interactive
   message, send the command:
      SUB SMS-SNUG YourFirstname YourLastname
      to LISTSERV@UNCVM1.BITNET.
   or to LISTSERV@UNCVM1.OIT.UNC.EDU.  For example:

   IBM VM CMS users would enter

   etc).

   More detailed information is available by sending an information
   request message to the list server. Use one of the following
   formats:

     INFO ?                      for a list of topics
     INFO topic                  where "topic" is one of the following:
                                 GENintro REFcard NEWs KEYwords

   Remember two simple rules-of-thumb:

     If it's a command (SUBscribe, Help, Info, UNSUBscribe, etc),
     send it to the list server (LISTSERV@uncvm1...).

     If it's a message for general distribution to the members of the
     list, send it to the list (SMS-SNUG@uncvm1...).

   The list is supported by the University of North Carolina
   Office of Information Technology. Our thanks to their management
   and staff for permission to use their VM system for the list and
   for assistance in setting it up.

softpats@uvmvm.uvm.edu

   In cooperation with UVM's Academic Computing Services, I would like to
   announce the creation of a mailing list for the discussion of software
   patents and related issues.

   The mailing list is called softpats@uvmvm.uvm.edu; this list is run by
   a list server, so to subscribe, send the text "sub softpats your-name"
   in thr BODY of a message to listserv@uvmvm.uvm.edu.

   This mailing list is, for the time being, NOT moderated.  Expected
   topics include legality and desirability of software patents,
   announcements of new patents granted, and actions taken by various
   groups for and against the patenting of software.  In order to keep
   noise to a minimum, discussion of look-and-feel issues will NOT be
   considered acceptable; gnu.misc.discuss is probably a more appropriate
   vehicle.

                Software Reviews and Related Issues

   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
       SOFTREVU will provide a forum where users of personal computers and
   other small computing systems can review, discuss, and examine software
   products.  Cross-platform compatibility issues related to software and
   hardware, with an emphasis placed on software, are also included in this
   forum.  The relevance, intentions, and uses of various software product
   categories, such as

   * Personal Information Managers (PIMs) * Connectivity (communications)
   * Utilities                            * Shells and "Front Ends"
   * Graphics (formats, design packages)  * Object-oriented Software
   * Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  * Programming Language Environments
   * Multimedia products                  * Integrated Packages
   * Desktop Publishing (DTP)             * The three "basics"--Databases,
                                            Spreadsheets and Text Managers

   are also included.  Multimedia-based integration of various application
   categories, discussed from a software perspective, is also encouraged.
   Software Products include new software packages as well as the latest
   upgrades/updates to existing software products/packages.  Members are
   encouraged to share knowledge of existing software packages in addition
   to that of new features being incorporated into upgrades of these
   products.  Members are also encouraged to share knowledge (such as the
   uses, applications, and features) of recently introduced software
   products.  Therefore, members of the list are encouraged to act as
   "consultants" and "enquirers" where appropriate.

       In accordance with current CREN regulations, commercial activity
   (such as the selling of software) will be prohibited.

   SCOPE:
       SOFTREVU is intended to cover all microcomputer platforms; such as
   the Apple Macintosh line, Amigas, IBM PS/2 line, PC compatibles, the
   NeXT machines, Sun and SPARC workstations, and the like.  Within the
   scope of these computing platforms, a wide range of software products
   exist.  Any and all of these products are viable discussion topics.
   SOFTREVU does not exist as a topic for issues of ethics in computing -
   see the ETHICS-L list.  However, the merits of software packages, such
   as their user interface, compatibility across disparate computing
   platforms, and the like, are acceptable topics.  List subscribers are
   encouraged to ask questions about software, and to offer up their
   opinions.  In keeping with current CREN (Corporation for Research and
   Educational Networking) and InterNET policies, subscribers are
   prohibited from attempting to sell software over the network.  However,
   the list moderators cannot be held responsible for the actions of list
   subscribers.

       SOFTREVU does not exist as a forum for the discussion of hardware or
   programming issues except where the relevance to existing or forthcoming
   software is explicit.  Hardware issues should be directed to the
   PCTECH-L and PCSUPT-L lists, which are geared toward discussions of that
   nature.  Programming and/or technical issues should be brought up in any
   of the various lists and special interest groups which are designed for
   this purpose.  Only extremely limited concerns in customization of
   existing software are included, such as writing simple macros, scripts,
   and other modest routines.  With respect to programming languages, the
   merits of the environment package - not the actual language - are
   appropriate for discussion.

   MEMBERSHIP:
       Any person who wishes to share knowledge, answer questions and/or
   desires to learn and ask questions is welcome.  Potential members
   include users, consultants, programmers, managers, and the like.  This
   list is intended to bring together people from all backgrounds to share
   information.

   GUIDELINES:
       SOFTREVU is a moderated list.  The atmosphere of this list is one of
   mutual support to all members and advocates cooperation.  Members are
   expected to engage in constructive criticism only.  Subscribers are
   requested to keep personal vendettas off the list.  This is not a forum
   for political or ethical discussions in any capacity; it is a forum for
   the discussion of software.  Problems or complaints should be addressed
   to the list moderators.  Anyone who does not maintain this policy, or is
   generally disruptive to the harmony of this list, will be removed.

   MODERATORS:
        Jamie Donnelly IV,   ENCSADM1@UCONNVM.BITNET
        Elaine Brennan,      ELAINE@BrownVM.Brown.EDU
        David B. O'Donnell,  EL406006@BrownVM.Brown.EDU

   ARCHIVING:
       The list will maintain monthly archives of discussions.  These
   archives will be purged periodically, removing outdated material, and to
   save system space and overhead.  Announcements will be made prior to
   major purges, but subscribers should expect purges every few months.  If
   necessary, either local or remote filespace may be set aside for the
   storage of documents of relevance to the list.

   ACCESSING THE LIST:
       To subscribe to SOFTREVU send the command,

        SUBSCRIBE SOFTREVU <yourname>

   to LISTSERV@BROWNVM (LISTSERV@BrownVM.Brown.EDU).  DO NOT SEND LIST

STUXCH-L@PSUVM.PSU.EDU     Student Exchanges
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   STUXCH-L@PSUVM is a list for students in art, architecture, and
   both visual and basic design.  If you are interested in making a
   student exchange in one of these areas then post your interest
   to this list.  While initially established for Pennsylvania
   State University the list is open to students in these fields
   at any institution.

   To subscribe to the list send e-mail to LISTSERV@PSUVM.BITNET
   (or LISTSERV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU on the Internet) with the following
   command in the body of the mail:
        SUB STUXCH-L yourfirstname yourlastname

   To obtain a list of files available send the following command

   Owner:  Harold Ray Lawrence   HRL@PSUARCH.BITNET

SUEARN-L on LISTSERV@UBVM (aka LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU)

   The SUEARN-L consists of news items, articles, and how-to questions
   about the ongoing work on connecting the U.S.S.R.  to international
   computer networks (the internet) contributed by its readers,
   cross-posted from other mailing lists, and retyped (usually without
   permission) from the "real" press.

   Topics often discussed include directions on reaching Soviet sites by
   e-mail, discussions of how modems and other equipment work over
   Soviet phone lines, technology export restrictions, and prospects for
   connecting more sites to the net.

   Submissions for the digest should be mailed to
   SUEARN-L@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU.  They will be automatically forwarded
   by the LISTSERV to the editor, who puts together the digest and mails
   one out every week or so.  Questions of the type "Is Soviet site S
   reachable by e-mail?" may be answered by private e-mail if the editor
   knows the answer.

   The digest is distributed by a LISTSERV mailing list.  As with other
   such lists, one subscribes by sending a NJE interactive message or
   mail saying in its body

      SUB SUEARN-L Your name

   to LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU (or any other LISTSERV).  If you try
   this and fail, ask one of the list owners to help you with your
   subscription.  Many sites channel SUEARN-L digests into NOTES, NEWS,
   RN, or similar systems that let many users read a single copy of the
   digest.  If you're at such a site, you can save some network
   bandwidth by reading such a "public" copy, instead of having your
   personal copy e-mailed to you.

   List Editor/Owner: Mike Meystel MEYSTMA@DUVM.BITNET
   List Owner:        Dimitri Vulis DLV@CUNYVMS1.BITNET


 Additional Information:

   Like most good things on Internet, SUEARN-L free, unless you use a
   commercial e-mail system, gatewayed to Internet, that charges you for
   incoming mail.  The digest is sent out about once a week, and is
   typically several hundred lines long.

   Please note that the Baltic states aren't considered to be part of
   USSR by the editors of this digest, and the discussion of e-mail
   connection to these countires should be sent to BALT-L, not to
   SUEARN-L;  but the discussion of computer network situation in
   Eastern and Central Europe as a whole (including, but not limited to
   the USSR) have been posted in the past.

   HISTORY: SUEARN-L was split off RusTeX-L in the summer of 1990.
   (RusTeX-L dealt originally with both quietions of Cyrillic (Russian
   and other) text processing and Soviet e-mail (the people interested
   in one are usually interested in the other)).  By that time, RusTeX-L
   traffic dealing with e-mail increased sufficiently to annoy those
   RusTeX-L readers not interested in the technical aspects of
   exchanging e-mail with the USSR, so SUEARN-L was born (leaving
   RusTeX-L for Cyrillic text processing discussions only), and reached
   its present form (a moderated weekly digest) after months of trial
   and error.

TeX-Pubs@SHSU.BITNET   TeX Publication Distribution List

   A new distribution list for TeX-related electronic form periodicals
   -- TeX-Pubs -- is being made available in addition to INFO-TeX for
   your convenience.  Initially, the distribution will include TeXhax
   Digest, UKTeX, and TeXMaG.

   The intent of TeX-Pubs is to allow users a single site for delivery
   of electronic form periodicals, such as TeXhax, UKTeX, and TeXMaG, as
   well as any others which may be brought to my attention (possibly
   also including the periodic "frequently asked questions" posts from
   USENET's comp.text.tex).  This list is offerred in lieu of directly
   posting these documents to INFO-TeX.  The decision to create a
   support list is in an effort to provide this information to
   interested readers, but not replicate it for those who wish to retain
   their current subscription(s) and not be bothered by extraneous
   material on INFO-TeX.

   There will be no direct archives for TeX-Pubs.  Instead, each of the
   included periodicals will have its own directory available for
   retrieval at FILESERV@SHSU.BITNET.

   If you would like to subscribe to TeX-Pubs, please MAIL the command:
   SUBSCRIBE TeX-Pubs                                 ====
   in the body of a message to LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET.  This LISTSERV is
   MAIL-oriented only;  interactive messages sent to
   LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET will be ignored.

   Any questions regarding TeX-Pubs or INFO-TeX should be directed to
   their owner:

THEOLOGY <U16481%UICVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU>
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   Mailing list dedicated to the intellectual discussion of religion. 
   Intellectual is stressed as opposed to the "personal", the inspirational, 
   or evangelistic.  This does not mean one cannot evangelize, but rather that
   participants should persuade rather than brow-beat or attack those they 
   disagree with.  Arguments are inevitable, but they ultimately should 
   resolve into mutual understanding or at least a truce.

   What are the fit subjects? - the Cosmos is the limit; some might be:

      World Religions - Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism 
      especially inter-religious dialogue.

      Apologetics - How should a religious perspective operate in relation to 
      critical questioning?  For example, can you prove God exists if evil 
      also does?

      Conversion - By what means or methods should one faith seek to increase 
      its members?  Or is this out-of-bounds in a pluralistic society?

      Dogma - What are the basic tenets of a world religion?  Are they 
      coherent?  Should they be?  What do they derive from, revelation or 
      something else?

      Ethics - Should religious beliefs and values seek to get involved in 
      politics?  Should an individual religious person seek to promote their 
      morals apart from their own religious communities?

TOOLB-L@AFSYSB.UARK.EDU
	TOOLB-L@UAFSYSB.BITNET  
	[Last Updated 12-October-1991]

   This list provides a discussion of Asymetrix ToolBook software,
   application development, and it's integration into a multimedia
   environment.  University of Arkansas serves as host to the
   listserver.

   TOOLB-L is a new list to provide an unmoderated environment where
   issues, questions, comments, ideas, and uses of Asymetrix's ToolBook
   and it's OpenScript language can be freely discussed.

   The explicit purpose of TOOLB-L is to provide timely interchange
   between subscribers, to provide a forum where interesting questions
   can be addressed within the context of interactive exchange between
   many individuals, and to discuss the evolution of ToolBook
   applications.  The discussions of TOOLB-L will be archived and
   available for reference.  In the future it is hoped this list will
   lead to the establishment of public domain toolbook archives.  These
   archives would be very similar to the currently existing archives of
   hypercard stacks.  As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the
   discussion and topics are only limited by the participation and
   interest of its subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an
   active role by posting to TOOLB-L or an inactive role by monitoring
   the list.

   To subscribe to TOOLB-L, please send a MAIL message to:
              LISTSERV@UAFSYSB.UARK.EDU or LISTSERV@UAFSYSB.BITNET

   The body of this MAIL message should be one line and contain the
   words:
       SUBSCRIBE TOOLB-L your name

   Correspondence to the list should be addressed to TOOLB-L@UAFSYSB.

   This list is a joint effort between the Kansas University Medical
   Center and the University of Arkansas.  Questions regarding this
   announcement should be addressed to:

THPHYSIO%FRMOP11.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list for accelerating exchanges of information between scientists 
   working in the field of thermal physiology, such as relevant advices, 
   queries, and ideas.  The list is also a good place to ask questions of 
   general interest; stimulating discussion on recent results or publications;
   and to provide an easy and cheap way to forward general announcements, such
   as congresses, new journals, administration, relevant news, etc.  This is 
   the job of the list moderators.  However, anyone who wishes to use the list
   for announcing interesting scientific events or meetings is invited to do 
   so, or to send the information to the moderators, allowing calls for 
   papers, bibliographies, and reports of lasting interest; obtaining, if 
   possible, the contents pages in electronic format of relevant journals 
   (such as J Thermal Biol, Am J Physiol, J Appl Physiol, Eur J Appl Physiol, 
   etc.) for publication in THPHYSIO.

   A side-effect of the list will be that any user can easily access the 
   E-Mail address of colleagues.  This may be useful for organizing joint 
   research projects, or for asking advice concerning specific technical 
   problems.

   BitNet users may subscribe by sending the following command to 
   LISTSERV@FRMOP11 via interactive message or mail:
      SUBscribe THPHYSIO Your full name
   where "Your full name" is your real name, not your login Id. Not-BitNet 
   users can join the list by sending the above command as the only line in 
   the text/body of a message to LISTSERV%FRMOP11.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

ultimate-list@doe.carleton.ca

   The purpose of this mailing list is to discuss the sport of ultimate.

   Details copied from the CFD of a usenet group along the same lines.
   If succesfull the usenet group will be gatewayed to the mailing list.

   BACKGROUND:

   Ultimate is a team sport based on the use of a flying disc
   (eg. a Frisbee (R)).  This sport has existed for 30 years and has gained
   tremendous popularity within the last ten years.  The majority of the
   players have been cultivated at the collegiate level but as those people
   move on they continue to play the sport and grow the player base.  This has
   resulted in the formation of club teams, summer leagues, corporate leagues
   and the like.  Ultimate is also played at the international level.

   Ultimate has a governing body, the Ultimate Players Association (UPA), which
   publishes and maintains the rules of the sport, organizes tournaments, and
   pulblishes a monthly magazine.

   CHARTER:

   Ultimate is still a very young sport and requires as many avenues of
   communication as possible to foster it's growth and visibility.

   Since many Ultimate players have found professions in the hi-tech industry,
   ie. there are hi-tech corporate Ultimate leagues throughout the US, a
   newsgroup would provide an excellent forum for

        o announcing leagues and other Ultimate happenings
        o disseminating information about tournaments
        o sport related discussions (ie. newly proposed rules)
        o providing players with a means to find teams in other
          parts of the country

   MODERATION STATUS: unmoderated

UNIX-SW@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   UNIX-SW is a vehicle for announcing the availablity of new major packages 
   of UNIX/'C' language software on the WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL repository.  
   This list will also be used to mail periodic updates of the list of all 
   UNIX software held at WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (probably monthly).

   UNIX-SW is not a forum for discussion of this software.  Such discussions 
   are more appropriately held with the authors, or in other groups.  Rather, 
   we are attempting to make known to the widest possible audience the 
   contents of this large repository of public-domain software.

   SIMTEL20 is a DEC-20 machine running the TOPS20 operating system, located 
   at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.  The machine is a host on the 
   Defense Data Network (DDN), and as such, gives users located on other hosts
   the capability of directly transferring this software via the FTP (file 
   transfer process) command.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   UNIX-SW-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.UNIX-SW>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   The repository has recently (Feb. '88) been completely reorganized by the 
   new coordinator.  The software is now stored in the directory PD2:<UNIX-C> 
   (it used to be stored in PD2:<UNIX>; this directory no longer exists).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to UNIX-SW-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   Coordinator: Dave Curry <DCURRY@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>
                           <davy@INTREPID.ECN.PURDUE.EDU>

UNIX-TeX@MIMSY.UMD.EDU

   Discussion of matters involved in porting TeX82 to Unix.  Messages sent to 
   the list are directly redistributed without human intervention.

   Archives are kept on MIMSY.UMD.EDU in the file:
      PS:<MAILING-LISTS>UNIX-TEX.ARC

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to UNIX-TeX-REQUEST@MIMSY.UMD.EDU.

   Coordinator: Richard Furuta <furuta@TOVE.UMD.EDU>

UNIX-WIZARDS@BRL.MIL

   Distribution list for people maintaining machines running the Unix 
   operating system.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to UNIX-WIZARDS-REQUEST@BRL.MIL.

   There is a BITNET/Netnorth/EARN sub-distribution list, UNIX-WIZ@NDSUVM1; 
   BNEnet subscribers can join by sending the SUB command with your name.
      For example, SEND LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 SUB UNIX-WIZ Jon Doe
   To be removed from the list, SEND LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 SIGNOFF.
   To make contributions to the list, BitNet subscribers should send mail to 
   the ARPANet list name, NOT to the BITNET list name.

URBAN-L%TREARN.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list for information exchange, ideas, etc. on the science of Urban 
   Planning.

   Yearly archives of the list will be maintained.

   BitNet users may join the list by sending the following command to 
   LISTSERV@TREARN via interactive message or e-mail:
      SUB urban-l Your full name
   where "Your full name" is your real name, not your login Id.
   Non-BitNet users can join by sending the above command as the only line in 
   the text/body of a message to LISTSERV%TREARN.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU.


URBANITES@PSYCHE.MIT.EDU

   The purpose of this mailing list is to discuss and promote self-sufficiency
   in everyday life in many forms.  This includes but is not limited to basic 
   needs such as food, shelter, health, and safety.  A unique aspect of this 
   list, however, unlike many others, is that we will concentrate on the city 
   and urban/semi-urbs applications of traditional self-sufficiency 
   technology.  Thus, discussions on raising fish in a small backyard pool or 
   in a large aquarium instead of in cage-culture rafts on a farm pond; 
   raising veggies and some small-tree fruits in containers on the patio or 
   under grow-lights at work (a ready source of fluorescent fixtures for most 
   of us!) instead of in a 20 x 40 garden plot "out back".

   Certainly folks in a more suburban setting (lucky them!) will find much of 
   the "urbanites" content useful, but the list is here first and foremost for
   those of us out here in the Concrete Jungle, for whatever reason.  Some of 
   us, like myself, are here using the city's resources to learn before 
   setting off for the country or the 'burbs, some are stuck in pay-our-debts 
   jobs here, and some just like the active city environment of places like 
   Harvard Square or Pike's Place.  But even though we rent our dwellings and 
   have a postage-stamp size yard, or none at all, we can still get into doing
   for ourselves in some of the ways our bucolic buddies do.

   Send requests to be added directly to urbanites-request@psyche.mit.edu
   and include  "urbanites-request" in your subject line.

UTS-L@YSUB.YSU.EDU
UTS-L@YSUB  (BitNet)

   Mailing list for discussion of Amdahl's UTS/580 implementation of Unix and 
   for software running in the UTS environment.  Some potential topics for 
   discussion: porting software, integrating with bitnet, internet, and 
   servers, requests for help, using UTS-specific features, hardware issues, 
   and anything else that's UTS-related.  Discussion should be limited to the 
   UTS environment (under VM or native),pso this list does not replace 
   info-unix, unix-wiz, aix-l, or any otherpmailing list.  Postings not 
   specific to UTS should be posted to one of those lists, instead.

   The discussion is not presently moderated, although if message traffic 
   warrants, it may be in the future.  All are free to post to the list, with 
   the condition that you must be subscribed to the list to post anything.  To
   help keep the noise down to a reasonable level, we would appreciate if you 
   would contact your site's UTS system administrator (aka "unix guru") for 
   help on your question, before you send it out to everyone.

   A monthly notebook of all discussions will be kept online, in files named 
   UTS-L LOGYYMM (UTS-L LOG9001, for example) on the Listserv.  To retrieve a 
   notebook, send e-mail or an interactive message to Listserv with a message 
   text/body of GET UTS-L LOGYYMM.  Listserv database services are also 
   available - send INFO DATABASE to the list-server for more information. 
   Notebooks will also be available via anonymous FTP to YSUB.YSU.EDU after 
   1/31/90.  More on this later.  Sorry, we don't have news (yet, anyway).

   BitNet users can subscribe by sending the following command to 
   LISTSERV@YSUB via interactive message or e-mail:
      SUB UTS-L Your full name
   where "Your full name" is your real name, not your login Id. Not-BitNet 
   users can join the list by sending the above command as the only line in 
   the text/body of an e-mail message to LISTSERV@YSUB.YSU.EDU.

   Administrative questions, problems, etc., should be sent to the

VIDEOTECH@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   VideoTech is a combination of the old HOME-SAT, VIDEO-DISC and TELETEXT 
   mailing lists.  WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL is the DDN side of this mailing list
   (which includes a USENET entry); USENET/netnews messages to rec.video will 
   find their way to this list without loops.  Appropriate topics for 
   discussion on VideoTech might be, but are not limited to:

      Home Satellite (TVRO, DBS)              Teletext
      Cable Television                        Stereo Television
      Video Disc Technology                   HighRes Television
      Video Tape Recorders (Beta/VHS/UMatic)

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   VIDEOTECH-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.VIDEOTECH>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP for those with TCP/IP access 
   to the Internet.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to VIDEOTECH-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   BitNet users can subscribe to the list through an automated BitNet mail 
   server.  To send a command to the server, simply send the command as the 
   text of a message.  Send all command-messages to LISTSERV@UIUCVMD.  The 
   command to subscribe yourself is:
      SUB  I-VIDTEK  (your personal name)
   The command to cancel your subscription is:
      UNSUB  I-VIDTEK
   Substitute your own personal name for the string "(your personal name)" in 
   the example above.  If you misspell your name, subscribe again, you do not 
   need to unsubscribe to fix a name spelling error.

VIRUS-L%LEHIIBM1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   Virus-L is a forum specifically for the discussion of computer virus 
   experiences, protection software, and other virus related topics.  The list
   is currently open to the public and is a non-digest format list.  Readers 
   who prefer digest format lists should periodically read the public back 
   logs of submissions, available from the LEHIIBM1 LISTSERV via a GET command
   (e.g., GET VIRUS-L LOG8806A for the first week of activity during June, 
   1988).  Mail sent to to Virus-L@LEHIIBM1.BITNET will automatically be 
   redistributed to everyone on the mailing list.  By default, you will NOT 
   receive a copy of your own letters.  If you wish to, send mail to the 
   LISTSERV saying
      SET VIRUS-L REPRO

   Archives are available, as is a file called DIRTY DOZEN which lists a 
   number of viruses, trojan horses, and pirated programs for the IBM PC.  All
   submissions to VIRUS-L are stored in weekly log files which can be 
   downloaded by any user on (or off) the mailing list.  There is also a small
   archive of some of the public anti-virus programs which are currently 
   available.  This archive, too, can be accessed by any user.  All of this is
   handled automatically by the LISTSERV.

   To find out what files are available on the LISTSERV, send mail to 
   LISTSERV%LEHIIBM1.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU saying
      INDEX VIRUS-L
   Note that filenames/extensions are separated by a space, and not by a 
   period.  Once you've decided which file(s) you want, send mail to LISTSERV 
   saying
      GET filename filetype
   For example, GET VIRUS-L LOG8804 would get the file called VIRUS-L LOG8804 
   (which happens to be the monthly log of all messages sent to VIRUS-L during
   April, 1988).  Note that, starting June 6, 1988, the logs are weekly.  The 
   new file format is VIRUS-L LOGyymmx where yy is the year (88, 89, etc.), mm
   is the month, and x is the week (A, B, etc.).  Readers who prefer digest 
   format lists should read the weekly logs and sign off of the list itself.

   To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1 (non-BitNet 
   users send mail to LISTSERV%LEHIIBM1.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU with the command
   in the message body):
      SUB VIRUS-L Your_Full_Name
   where Your_Full_Name is your real name, not your userid.
   To unsubscribe, send:
      SIGNOFF VIRUS-L

   All other requests, problems, questions, etc., should be sent to the 
   Coordinator.

   A list for the discussion and redistribution of useful and interesting 
   utilities for use by the VM/SP and CMS operating systems.  There is also a 
   FILELIST by the same name which will be used to store some of the utilities
   collected.

   The list is hosted at DEARN, MARIST, TECMTYVM, TREARN, UBVM, UCF1VM, and 
   UTARLVM1.  There is also a companion FILELIST available from the LISTSERV's
   at DEARN, MARIST, UBVM, UCF1VM, and UTARLVM1 which contains a lot of useful
   VM- and CMS-related utilities that people have contributed.  If anyone is 
   interested in contributing a utility to be stored in the FILELIST, they can
   send a note telling what they wish to contribute along with a description 
   of each utility.  Source code is prefered.

   To subscribe send the following command to
   LISTSERV@[one of the above hosts]  (non-BitNet users send mail to
                    LISTSERV%[one of the above].BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU)

VMVIRUS on LISTSERV@PCCVM

   After consulting with the folks 'attached' to VIRUS-L and seeing a
   void in the area of centralized information about VM, MVS, and VSE
   viri and worms, I have established a list VMVIRUS at my node.  This
   list is open and public, but as the following text will describe,
   some files will be restricted.  Be aware that a posting to this list
   will automatically be forwarded to VIRUS-L.
        -------------------------------------

   This list has been established to act as a clearing house / archival
   location for comments and information concerning VM viruses and
   worms.  The logs are public and your comments well be freely
   available to the network community.  I intend to also store samples
   of source, object, and executable code for examination by selected
   persons.  Commonly these files will only be available to NADs and
   other selected interested parties.  Application may be made for code
   samples.  Userid authenticity WILL BE verified prior to dispersal of
   infectious programs.

   So far the VM community has been spared many of the problems that
   currently plague the PC, MAC and Unix worlds.  Let us hope that it
   remains that way.  This archive is intended as a step in the
   direction to halt the spread of such malicious programming.

   While the name VMVIRUS implies a limitation to the VM environment,
   this list is open to comments by MVS and VSE users also.  I would
   urge VM, MVS, and VSE sites to send samples of infectious code for
   storage.  The following rules MUST be adhered to in the transmission
   of potentially harmful programs.

      1.  Send notification to myself (SYSMAINT@PCCVM) prior to transmission.
      2.  De-activate the code if possible
      3.  Transmit the code to SECURE@PCCVM
      4.  Do not include code in a 'mail-gram'

   This site maintains a 'filter' for known infectious materials, hence
   the required pre-transmission notification.  Let all work together to
   restore the 'clean' computing environment that we used to have and to
   assist in the eradication / prosecution of offenders.

   To subscribe to VMVIRUS send mail or interactive message to
   LISTSERV@PCCVM on BITNET with the TEXT or BODY of the message
   containing the command:

   The following statement of purpose for the list was provided by the
   sponsor and list owner, Lance Hayes (C0334@UMRVMB.UMR.EDU).

   The purpose of Xcult-X, Intercultural Communication Practicum, is to
   foster interdisciplinary discussions of communication philosophy,
   theory, and practice in the global village through formation of a
   discussion group via human computer-mediated communication.

   Xcult-X is a rule-free discussion group open to all.  It is sponsored
   by Lance Haynes who refuses to take any power other than that firmly
   imposed by the host computer center.  Requests for listowner to exert
   any power whatsoever over the topics or discussion methods on this
   list will be met with referral to group discussion.

   The Intercultural Communication Practicum is a "child" of the
   International Intercultural Newsletter in that Xcult-X was begun in
   an effort to house discussion topics and methods that originated on
   Xcult-L but were not in keeping with its announced purposes.

Y-RIGHTS@SJUVM.BITNET  "Discussion on the Rights of Kids and Teenagers"
	[Last Updated 28-January-1992]

   As the title suggests, this list is on the Discussion of the Rights
   of Kids and Teenagers (called Y-Rights for "Youth Rights", or
   "Youngster's Rights" or "Why Rights?"...  whichever strikes your
   fancy :D ).
 
   It's a very open list, and everyone is welcome to participate on it,
   whether you are a teacher, a professional, a student, or a kid or
   teenager yourself.
 
   What do I mean when I say "Children's Rights"?  Well, I don't
   necessarily mean the rights for adults to "protect" children, because
   that "right" seems to be misused and misguided to ends that are,
   oftentimes, tragic, even with the 'best' intentions.  That, of
   course, is open for discussion on this list, and I'm certain that it
   will come up at some point.
 
   In my ever changing view of rights for those under the `age of
   majority' (which is 18 or 21 in the United States, depending on how
   you view it, and different in other countries), I am looking more for
   changes in our judicial system, educational system, and our society,
   as a whole, to view youth as Human Beings first and foremost, before
   concerning themselves with the `correct manners to treat, mold and
   shape a child', as if s/he is just a ball of clay, and not a human
   being.
 
   So, with that, I welcome you.  Come to talk, or come to listen.
   Speak up anytime, even if just to say "Hi, I'm still here...."
 
   To add yourself to the list, send an Interactive Message (BITNET) or
   a Mail message (any system) to LISTSERV@SJUVM with a single line:
 
      SUB Y-RIGHTS Firstname Lastname
 
   This particular LISTSERV takes a minimum of two names, but it can
   take three, four or more (for example, "J.  P. Zelder Hoghorn III" is
   acceptable.  "John" will not work).
 
   Owner:
         Kenneth Udut
         kudut@hamp.hampshire.edu
         kudut@hampvms.bitnet
 
   Also, there will soon be a Weekly Digest form of the list.  The
   Digest will be an AFD (Automatic File Distribution) of the weekly
   Log, and will therefore not conform to RFC 1153 or RFC 934.  I will
   post to New-List when the Digest Set-up is completed.  --Ken
