The Electric Mystic's Guide has been made possible through the
support of the Research Centre for the Study of Religion,
Department of Religious Studies, University of Ottawa, and through
funding from the American Academy of Religion. The gopher-
accessible version of this guide was made possible through the
cooperation of the Department of Religious Studies, Carleton
University and a variety of benevolent deities responsible for the
care and feeding of UNIX computers.
 
The author gratefully acknowledges the helpful support of the
Computing and Communications Services of the University of Ottawa
and Carleton University. This guide is the result of hundreds of
e-mail queries, and  countless calls and visits to the computing
help desk of the University of Ottawa over the past two years. I
am particularly indebted to David Sutherland (Director, Carleton
University Computing and Communication Services), Peter Hickey
(xxxx, University of Ottawa), our site Postmaster, Tram Nguyen,
and the many dedicated individuals at the University of Ottawa
Computing Help Desk.
 
Special thanks to Ann Okerson, for encouraging me to see this
through, and to Harry Gilmer, for his willingness to support this
project through publication under Scholars Press.

__________________________________________________________________
 
                        * Introduction *
__________________________________________________________________
 
The Electric Mystic's Guide is a non-technical survey of all major
documents, archives and services of relevance to Religious Studies
and related fields that are available through the international,
academic computer networks commonly referred to as the Net
(BITNET, Internet and affiliated networks). This includes
networked papers, reviews, book notes, dissertations, major sacred
texts, software programs, electronic mail address collections,
general information files, data banks, electronic journals,
newsletters, online discussion groups, specialized commercial and
public networks, and relevant networked organizations,
associations, institutions and companies. It should be noted that
the Electric Mystic's Guide is not meant to be a handbook on how
to use the Net, and thus assumes a certain level of familiarity
with FTP, Telnet, LISTSERV and other Net operating programs.
Nonetheless, extensive instructions have been included in the
guide to ensure that readers will be able to access the material
documented herein.
 
It is interesting to note that the vast majority of the
approximately 300 files documented in this guide have been placed
on the Net in the last three years. This would suggest that the
end of this decade will see well over two thousand networked
documents relevant to Religous Studies. The number of Religious
Studies and related scholars presently online is unknown but
certainly exceeds ten thousand. No comprehensive electronic mail
address book for Religious Studies exists at this point in time.
We can look forward to a proliferation of specialized archives
over the next few years.
 
Electronic mail addresses given within this guide are in BITNET
and Internet format, unless otherwise stated. Login to FTP nodes
listed herein as anonymous with your e-mail address as the
password unless otherwise stated. All other aspects of this guide
are system neutral. Travellers on the Net should note that there
are many versions of Telnet and FTP software and a variety of
login procedures. Most systems will offer some form of help if you
enter the command HELP or ?.
 
The Electric Mystic's Guide was previously written as one complete
document but has been divided into two volumes, due to its growing
size and technical restrictions within some systems on the size of
network accessible manuscripts. The guide has the following
format: Volume One documents a wide variety of network-accessible
files and software programs of direct and indirect relevance to
Religious Studies and related fields. The selection of material
was based on the scholarly nature of the documents or their
significance as general information files. No attempt has been
made to document every file related to religion on the Net, due to
the transient nature, and questionable academic value of some of
the material that has be placed on network fileservers. If a
document has been overlooked that the reader feels should be
listed in the Electric Mystic's Guide, please contact the author
with details of its content and location. Volume One also has
extensive information on how to retrieve documents listed in this
guide, how to use Archie, LISTSERV and FTP, and how to search
LISTSERV logbooks. Readers will find interesting Net tidbits,
information servers and archives mentioned in the boxes titled FYI
throughout this guide.
 
Volume Two provides information on relevant networked
organizations, online academic conferences, journals and
newsletters, commercial Religious Studies related networks,
detailed information on network-accessible document archives of
interest to this field and various other relevant scholarly
sources and forums to be found within the emerging Electric Gaia.
 
Each volume has its own index. Volume One also includes an index
of network tools, systems, archives, and commands documented
herein (page 98). The low ASCII versions of the Electric Mystic's
Guide do not contain these indexes.
 
Please note that the LISTSERV fileserver of the online academic
conference, IOUDAIOS, will be changing its e-mail addresses at
some point in mid 1993. If you find that the addresses
listserv@yorkvm1 or listserv@vm1.yorku.ca do not work, please
contact the list moderator (David Reimer dreimer4@mach1.wlu.ca)
for the new address.
 
*  A Note to New Networkers
 
It is impossible for this guide to tell you everything that you
will need to know about using the Net. It is therefore strongly
recommended that the new networker begin by identifying local
support personnel and make friends with them (take them out to
dinner, buy them a large gift), take a course or two in the use of
your local system and electronic mail, and subscribe, as soon as
you know how, to the online forum HELP-NET. Send the e-mail
message SUBSCRIBE HELP-NET your name to listserv@templevm or
listserv@vm.temple.edu. HELP-NET is intended for the new user and
is the best online forum for asking questions about how to use the
Net and how to find information within it. An index is available
that lists very helpful information files available from the HELP-
NET fileserver. Send the command INDEX HELP-NET to
listserv@templevm or listserv@vm.temple.edu for the index of
files.
 
The Electric Mystic's Guide assumes that the reader has a basic
grasp of electronic mail (e-mail) and is able to send mail on his
or her own local system. It also assume that the reader has
already installed a modem and knows how to use their own personal
computer and communication software. The numerous types of
mainframe systems and communication software make it impossible
for the guide to give details on how to download or upload a file
or program from a mainframe to a personal computer.
 
 
      WARNING:  I cannot possibly answer every query from
      readers concerning how to use e-mail, upload files,
      install a modem, unzip a file or overcome unrequited
      love. The main intention behind this guide is not to
      instruct the reader on how to overcome every
      unforeseeable problem but to equip the reader with
      basic resources, direct to appropriate online forums,
      and engender skills that will help the new networker
      become proficient both at mining the Net and at
      network research problem solving. I will gladly answer
      queries concerning errors and problems within the
      Electric Mystic's Guide. Inappropriate queries will
      receive a pre-written reply that directs the reader to
      more appropriate online sources of instruction and
      information.
 
 
            *  The Networks Covered in this Guide  *
 
The following are the main networks that are documented in the
Electric Mystic's Guide. To make effective use of this guide, you
should know what network your e-mail account is on. New users of
the Net are advised to take local courses on the use of their
network's systems. Note that some sites have both BITNET, Internet
and USENET connections. It is up to your local system
administration if USENET newsgroups are made available in part or
whole. Readers interested in further details about these and other
networks are encouraged to read John S. Quarterman's The Matrix:
Computer Networks and Conferencing Systems Worldwide (Bedford,
Massachusetts: Digital Press, 1990, ISBN: 1-55558-033-5).
 
  BITNET    BITNET (Because It's Time NETwork)
            connects over three thousand hosts in over
            32 countries. BITNET's main feature is the
            automatic mailing program called LISTSERV.
            LISTSERV fileservers maintain archives of
            primarily low ASCII documents and also
            runs LISTSERV discussion groups, also
            known as lists. BITNET does not support
            FTP or Telnet. BITNET is connected to
            identical networks in Canada and Europe
            named NetNorth and EARN.
 
  Internet  The Internet is actually a worldwide
            internetwork, a large collection of over
            5,000 networks across the globe. The
            Internet is so large that its size can
            only be estimated. Current numbers put the
            Internet at over one million hosts and ten
            million users. Most North American
            universities are connect via the Internet.
            Users on the Internet can access FTP and
            LISTSERV fileservers and also use Telnet.
            Most Internet sites will have access to
            USENET newsgroups.
 
  USENET    USENET (User's Network) is a worldwide
            network that has one main service, news or
            newsgroups, a collection of over 300
            different online discussion groups. See
            the section, USENET -- General
            Information, Volume Two, for more
            information about USENET.
 
  Denominational
  Networks  There are a number of denominational
            networks throughout North America. These
            networks connect church related
            organizations and church members. The
            denominational networks documented thus
            far in this guide are those belonging to
            Ecunet. See Volume Two for information on
            Ecunet.

The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy describes the universe as
being "Big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely
mindbogglingly big it is" (as related by Douglas Adams). I mention
this because when people start talking about the Net, the
conversation tends to take a similar direction. Like the universe,
both the size and growth rate of the Net has the effect of sending
users into fits of metaphorical frenzy. Any numbers used to
describe the Net are usually guestimates (a lot depends on how you
define the "Net") but it does help to frame any discussion about
the utility of the Net as a research tool by noting that through
it, one is connected to perhaps as many as ten million other
individuals worldwide. At last count, the Internet alone connected
over five thousand sub-networks, and one million hosts, each of
which may in turn be connected to anywhere from zero to one
thousand or more other computers or terminals. The number of files
and programs that can be accessed through the Net has been
estimated at over one million, containing roughly the equivalent
of 100 gigabytes of free programs and information, or more than
you could possibly read in what little spare time you have to
spare. Like some benevolent, virus, the truly shocking thing about
the Net is that it is doubling in size every year.
 
What makes all this talk of millions-of-this and gigabytes-of-that
rather impressive is the way that it has effected not just a few
computer wizards and midnight hackers, but governments. Large
governments with big budgets. The government of the United states
of America is taking the Net seriously enough to consider
reallocating billions of dollars from its military budget towards
the development of the National Research and Education Network
(NREN). NREN will link all educational institutions, from
elementary schools to universities, with research centres,
libraries and government databases through a national high
performance computer network. Not to be outdone in the area of
technology, Japan is intent on developing a national fibre optic
network capable of transmitting complete multi-media services to
homes and business by the year 2015. Whereas transportation
technology was the basis of the industrial revolution, global
computer networks are quickly becoming the primary infrastructure
of this age of information and its proliferation of minor
revolutions. Government and businesses are busy trying to ensure
that they end up on the winning side of any coming revolution
(always an asset come election time) and there are a number of
tell tale signs that the academic community is on the verge of
embracing the Net as an integral part of the way it does business.
 
While the Net is expanding at a mindboggling rate, it must be
remembered that, above all else, it is young. Desk top computing
only took off in the mid-eighties, in the seventies computers were
portrayed in cinema as monsters in the care of white-coated
"scientist". Five years ago perhaps as much as fifty percent of
the Net did not exist. So we are very much in the middle of a
global birthing, which is the primary reason for all the "ooohhs
and aaahs" and speculation on what the Net will be when it grows
up and who it will look like (capitalist, socialist or
anarchist?). Many of the archives and systems on the Net have been
started or developed in the past few years, so while the Net is
not quite yet the "ultimate" resource and research tool, it does
hold forth much promise for scholars and students of Religious
Studies and related disciplines (indeed, all of academia).
 
Over the next few short years we can look forward to the growth of
extensive network-accessible archives of secondary and even
primary material for Religious Studies, much of which will be
available at no cost to the user. This guide will continue to
provide an overview of these network-accessible archive projects,
such as the Aboriginal Studies Electronic Data Archive, the
CONTENTS Project, the Coombspapers Social Sciences Research Data
Bank, the Electronic Buddhist Archives, the American Arab
Scientific Society Software Library and the Israel Project at
Nysernet (see Volume Two for details). We will also see a
proliferation of network-distributed electronic serials for
Religious Studies and an expanding number of online academic
discussion groups of increasing quality and size.
 
An excellent example of how Religious Studies departments can make
use of the Internet is seen in the CCAT Gopher database. This is a
Gopher database of course materials for University of Pennsylvania
Humanities (Classical and Religious Studies) courses, accessed at
ccat.sas.upenn.edu. This database contains complete electronic
primary texts, course syllabi, glossaries, photograph and sound
archives, and related pedagological material. This Gopher database
is a sample of what we can expect to see much more of on the
Internet in the near future.
 
All of these resources will be documented through an Internet-
accessible CONTENTS Project gopher server that will provide Net
users with an online version of The Electric Mystic's Guide and
also allow for online reading of many of the bibliographies,
reviews and other files documented in this guide. To find out if
this gopher server is now available, send the command GET GOPHER
INFO to listserv@uottawa or listserv@acadvm1.uottawa.ca or
retrieve the file gopher-info.txt from the FTP node
panda1.uottawa.ca in the /pub/religion/ directory.
 
The following are some examples of how the Net has proven useful
to a variety of individuals, scholars and researchers around the
world.
 
*  The Internet has provided me with access to several religion
scholars who have been very helpful and willing to correspond with
me on various issues. (Carl Briggs, Director of Public Relations,
Alderson-Broaddus College, Philippi, West Virgina.)
 
*  Networking has helped me in that I have been able to post
inquiries concerning projects I'm working on and solicit
submissions for an anthology that I am currently compiling. I
doubt that I would have obtained the response I have received at
such a low cost if I had sent out my notices via snail (surface)
mail. Also, I have been able to communicate with many brilliant
minds, on subjects of mutual interest to us, although that has not
precluded some really silly disagreements as well. I am quite
happy to have discovered this "magical process," and wonder how I
managed without it before. (Lin Collette, Brown University.)
 
*  One of the best uses of the Net is this: obtaining a quick and
accurate, informed answer to a question that has one flummoxed. It
happened to me. Right in the middle of a lecture on the Upper
Palaeolithic period and how scholars approach research today a
student asked: "When did Race begin?" Darned if I knew. But I did
know the question was one worth asking. So I posted the question
to the anthropology and archaeology lists (online academic
conferences), and the result was that when I walked into class the
next week I had pulled together a really informed discussion of
race as both social and biological construct. (Maureen Korp,
University of Ottawa)
 
*  Our article, "On the Logic of the Ontological Argument"
(Philosophical Perspectives 5, J. Tomberlin (ed.), Atascadero:
Ridgeview, 1991) was selected for the 1992 Philosopher's Annual as
being among the ten best articles in philosophy to appear in print
the previous year. The seminal idea in the article was conceived
and formalized in a face-to-face discussion, but with the
exception of a few phone calls, our subsequent work took place via
the Internet. Drafts of the paper were exchanged and discussed by
FTP and e-mail. The fine tuning of the paper, however, was
accomplished by online "chat" sessions, in which we used the cut
and paste functions of a windowing system to transfer text from
the online chat session into the source file. And, of course, we
used e-mail to keep in touch about the subsequent publication
details. (Paul E. Oppenheimer,  Thinking Machines Corporation and
Edward N. Zalta, Stanford University).
 
*  Electronic Mail has been an invaluable discovery. It allows
conversation with scholars all over the world on particular items
of interest. Frequently in a university department, one may be the
only person interested in a given topic. But, on the Net, all
those who share an interest can converge. I've been able to locate
addresses for scholars in a matter of minutes, hours, days; when,
through usual channels, this may have taken months. For example,
just recently I had been searching for a scholar for weeks; he was
in Britain, but where? By chance, someone from his institution put
out a query over the Net. With his help, I finally made contact
with the "missing" person. It seems he was no longer listed in the
Commonwealth faculty directory because he had become the
University Registrar and was no longer teaching. The electronic
speed of communication is astonishing. To write to Europe usually
takes a minimum of two weeks. I can type a message to England and
have my answer by the next day, if not sooner. And, believe it or
not, I have even found a long-lost relative over the Net. (Renee
H. Bennett, St. Louis University).
 
*  FYI -- The Directory of Electronic Journals an Newsletters  *
 
The Directory of Electronic Journals and Newsletters is intended
to provide a comprehensive listing of all electronic journals and
newsletters which are of academic interest and available through
BITNET, Internet and any affiliated networks. This directory is
part of an ongoing project and is updated as new electronic
journals and newsletters come into existence and as existing
entries are changed. Every effort has been made to provide the
user with up-to-date information. Most entries have been either
provided from or scrutinized by the journal and newsletter editors
themselves to assure accuracy.
 
Internet users can read an online version of the Directory of
Electronic Journals and Newsletters by Gopher or Telnet to the
University of Maryland's Info Server. This server will send you
any of its files via e-mail, so it is a particularly useful
resource.
 
      Telnet Access:  telnet info.umd.edu
 
      Select ReadingRoom then Newsletters then
      DirectoryofENews
 
      Gopher Access:  gopher info.umd.edu
 
      Select Info - Gopher Interface then ReadingRoom then
      Newsletters then DirectoryofENews.

       * How to Retrieve Documents Listed in This Guide *
__________________________________________________________________
 
The following describes how to retrieve documents listed in the
Electric Mystic's Guide from LISTSERV and FTP archives. One way to
think of the Net is to imagine a giant computer hard drive that
contains countless files in thousands of directories. LISTSERV and
FTP are the two main programs for retrieving files from this
global hard drive. This section will also describe how to search
LISTSERV logbooks and databases, how to use BITFTP and FTPMAIL,
and how to uncompress files.
 
*  Retrieving Documents via LISTSERV
 
LISTSERV (which means "list server") is the automated system that
runs on IBM/VM computers. LISTSERV runs BITNET based discussion
groups called lists (sometimes referred to as online academic
discussion groups in the guide) and also maintains fileservers
that store documents and some programs. This guide documents all
LISTSERV based lists and documents that are of direct interest to
Religious Studies and related areas (see Volume Two). Whenever you
send a mail message to an address that starts with listserv@ you
are actually sending a command to a computer program, not to a
person. You can always get help from LISTSERV by sending the
command HELP. The Electric Mystic's Guide has instructions on the
following aspects of LISTSERV:
 
Retrieving Documents via LISTSERV               (this section)

Users that are not on the Internet will not be able to make direct
use of FTP. These users should see, BITFTP -- Princeton BITNET FTP
Server, page 14 and FTPMAIL, page 13 .
 
*  Sending Commands to LISTSERV
 
When you wish to retrieve a document that is stored on a LISTSERV
fileserver, the best way to do this is to send an e-mail message
to LISTSERV that contains the command you want it to execute. But
first, to retrieve a document from a LISTSERV fileserver you need
to know the LISTSERV fileserver's address and the document name. A
LISTSERV fileserver address will always look like this:
 
      (BITNET Address)        (Internet Address)
      listserv@xxxx     or    listserv@xxx.xxx.xxx
      listserv@uottawa  or    listserv@acadvm1.uottawa.ca
 
The "@" means "at" and on some systems you must write the address
like this:
 
listserv at uottawa     or          listserv at acadvm1.uottawa.ca
 
You can tell a BITNET address from an Internet address by how many
sections follow the @. A BITNET address will only have one
section, as in @uottawa whereas an Internet address will always
have two or more sections separated by periods, as in
@acadvm1.uottawa.ca. This is important to remember because if you
are on Internet you must use Internet style addresses. Some
Internet based systems will only allow you to use Internet
addresses, some will allow for both types of addresses. The
Electric Mystic's Guide gives both Internet and BITNET addresses
for LISTSERV fileservers whenever possible.
 
LISTSERV will tell you the BITNET version of an Internet e-mail
address or the Internet version of a BITNET e-mail address if you
send it the command: SHOW ALIAS address where address is the
BITNET or Internet address of which you want a "translation". For
example, if you send the command SHOW ALIAS UOTTAWA as a mail
message to listserv@uottawa (or any other LISTSERV), you will get
an answer back in the form of an e-mail message that says:
UOTTAWA is also known as acadvm1.uottawa.ca.
 
Files on LISTSERV fileservers will always have two parts to their
name, usually referred to as filename filetype. Both parts are
never more than eight characters long.
 
In the Electric Mystic's Guide, files on LISTSERV fileservers are
usually referred to like this:
 
 Kraft, Robert A. Philo and the Sabbath Crisis:  Alexandrian
      Jewish Politics and the Dating of Philo's Works.
      (Version 2, 1990). Available from IOUDAIOS,
      listserv@yorkvm1 or listserv@vm1.yorku.ca as SABBATH
      ARTICLE.
 
The author's name is given first, then the full title of the file,
date of electronic publication, name of the online academic
conference (list) that has archived the file (here it is
IOUDAIOS), and then the address of the LISTSERV fileserver, here
given as listserv@yorkvm1 (BITNET) or listserv@vm1.yorku.ca
(Internet). The LISTSERV file here is SABBATH ARTICLE. The name of
a LISTSERV file in this guide is always written in capital
letters. This is done simply to distinguish them from FTP file
names, which are always case sensitive. LISTSERV is not case
sensitive so they may be typed in lower and/or upper case letters.
 
There are two ways in which to retrieve a document from a LISTSERV
fileserver, once you know the address and file name. You can send
an e-mail message directly to a fileserver (leave the subject line
blank and turn off any automatic signature files). To retrieve the
above file, for example, send an e-mail message to
listserv@yorkvm1 or listserv@vm1.yorku.ca with a single line
saying:
 
      GET SABBATH ARTICLE
 
Those on PROFS mailers should note that messages sent to LISTSERV
must be sent as MAIL and not as DOCUMENT.
 
If your system has interactive messaging capability (BITNET
systems do, Internet systems do not), you can send the GET command
from the system prompt (not as a mail message)  like this:
 
TELL LISTSERV AT YORKVM1 GET SABBATH ARTICLE    (VM/CMS users)
SEND LISTSERV AT YORKVM1 GET SABBATH ARTICLE    (VAX users)
 
This command may differ on other systems. Note that even if your
system has interactive TELL or SEND capability, it is nonetheless
safer to send LISTSERV commands as mail messages, as they will not
be subject to becoming "lost" on the way to the remote computer.
You can also send more than one command at a time in a mail
message to LISTSERV, just remember to put only one GET file name
request per line.
 
For a complete list of useful LISTSERV commands, send the command
INFO REFCARD to any LISTSERV.
 
Some systems will send a file retrieved from LISTSERV directly to
your filelist or account directory. Other systems will send you a
message when the file has arrived. The file may arrive in a few
minutes or a few hours, depending on the size of the file and the
time of day. If you are on a VAX/VMS machine, enter the command
RECE * to move the file into your account directory or filelist.
Then enter TYPE SABBATH ARTICLE to read the file. If you are using
an IBM VM/CMS system, type RDRL or READERLIST and use the RECEIVE
command to move the file into your account filelist. The file can
then be read by entering XEDIT SABBATH ARTICLE at the Ready;
prompt. For more information on how to use various system mailers
and editors, such as UNIX, VAX and VM, see System-Specific Guides,
page 28
 
You can add the command F=MAIL to the end of a request for a file
from LISTSERV and this will cause the file to be sent as a mail
message straight to your mailbox. This command is used as follows:
GET SABBATH ARTICLE F=MAIL and can be used interactively or within
a mail message to LISTSERV.
 
 
       *  How to Retrieve LISTSERV List Indexes and Files *
 
If you simply want to retrieve the entire logbooks or some other
file from a LISTSERV fileserver, send the command INDEX listname
to the address of the list. For example: to get a list of files
and logbooks available from the LISTSERV list about humanities
computing, HUMANIST, send the command INDEX HUMANIST as an e-mail
message to listserv@brownvm. This will return a filelist, which is
a list of all available logbooks and files from HUMANIST. To
retrieve a particular file, send the command GET file name to
listserv@brownvm, where file name is the name of the desired file
taken from the file list.
 
                   Searching LISTSERV Logbooks
 
LISTSERV list logbooks (records of past conversations and
postings) can be searched remotely by sending LDBASE commands as
e-mail messages to a list's database of logbooks. An information
file that explains how to do this is available by sending the
command GET LISTDB MEMO to any LISTSERV address (for example, to
listserv@uottawa or listserv@acadvm1.uottawa.ca). Charles W.
Bailey Jr., has written a simplified explanation of how to search
LISTSERV logbooks using LDBASE. This document may be retrieved as
the file pacsl_dbms.txt via FTP from the node hydra.uwo.ca in the
/libsoft/ directory. The following will give some brief examples
of how you can send interactive and batch job e-mail messages
using LDBASE to search the logbooks of online academic
conferences. Note that LDBASE will only work with LISTSERV based
lists (not Internet interest groups or USENET newsgroups).
 
*  Batch Jobs With LDBASE
 
The best way to use LDBASE batch jobs is to start by creating a
permanent file on your e-mail account that can be retrieved into
an e-mail message for sending to LISTSERV. This file should have
the following lines in it:
 
      // JOB ECHO=NO
      DATABASE SEARCH DD=RULES
      // RULES DD *
      SEARCH
      INDEX
      //
 
I have named this file LDBASE JOB on my e-mail account and simply
retrieve it into a mail item when I wish to search a LISTSERV
database or collection of logbooks. LDBASE can be used to search
the CONTENTS Project for updated sections of the Electric Mystic's
Guide. To do this, send the following LDBASE batch job as an e-
mail message to listserv@uottawa or listserv@acadvm1.uottawa.ca
 
      // JOB ECHO=NO
      DATABASE SEARCH DD=RULES
      // RULES DD *
      SEARCH BIBLIOGRAPHIES UPDATE in CONTENTS
      INDEX
      //
 
Note that all posted updates of the Electric Mystic's Guide will
use the original section names, such as Bibliographies, Buddhism
and Related Topics, Sacred Texts (Networked Electronic Versions),
an so on as the subject heading plus the word Update. This is done
to facilitate searching for updates via LDBASE. The above command
will return the following e-mail message:
 
Item #   Date   Time  Recs   Subject
------   ----   ----  ----   -------
000051 92/05/19 11:33  107   Directory of Online Religion Scholars
000080 92/06/25 12:00  166   Electronic Buddhist Archives ( Part 1
000081 92/06/25 12:05  308   Electronic Buddhist Archives ( Part 2
000117 92/10/09 20:31  869   BTS BULLETIN ( 2/2)
000150 92/11/11 15:31  258   MISC: Bibliographies Update
000154 92/12/10 16:39   80   Changes to the Contents Project
 
Now you can send another LDBASE batch job that will return the
actual bibliographies section update. Note that you must repeat
the search command:
 
      // JOB ECHO=NO
      DATABASE SEARCH DD=RULES
      // RULES DD *
      SEARCH BIBLIOGRAPHIES UPDATE in CONTENTS
      PRINT 150
      //
 
LDBASE can be used to search the past conversations on online
academic conferences such as IOUDAIOS, ELENCHUS and HUMANIST.
Simply e-mail the batch job to the address of the LISTSERV list in
question (for example, listserv@brownvm for HUMANIST), change the
word "CONTENTS" (above) to the list name, and replace
"BIBLIOGRAPHIES UPDATE" with the desired keyword. LDBASE is quite
sophisticated and can use AND, OR, NOT, and other modifiers. For
complete information on how to use LDBASE, send the command GET
LISTDB MEMO to any LISTSERV address (for example, to
listserv@uottawa or listserv@acadvm1.uottawa.ca).
 
*  Interactive Searching
 
BITNET users can search remote LISTSERV databases interactively by
first getting the LDBASE user interface (program) by sending the
following commands to your nearest LISTSERV:
 
For VM/CMS systems:     TELL LISTSERV GET LDBASE
                        TELL LISTSERV GET LSVIUCV MODULE
For VAX/VMS systems:    SEND LISTSERV GET LDBASE COM
 
After you have received these files into your e-mail account disk,
enter the command LDBASE at your system prompt. This will start
your interactive session. LDBASE will ask you to enter the
LISTSERV address you wish to connect to by default. I answered
TEMPLEVM to this, as this is where the HELP-NET logbooks are kept.
LDBASE will then ask you to "Please enter the userid of the
LISTSERV server at TEMPLEVM, or a blank line if it is "LISTSERV".
Just hit enter. Now you will see the following appear on your
screen:
 
welcome to listserv@templevm - release 1.7e, backbone server.
Cpu model 3084, dasd model 3380.
Enter command, or "quit" to exit:
 
A few sample commands that you could send are as follows:
 
      search FTP in HELP-NET
 
Which will return the message:
 
      Search started...
      CONNECT= 00:09:12 VIRTCPU= 000:00.16 TOTCPU= 000:00.33
      --> Database HELP-NET, 694 hits.
 
To get a complete list of all these hits, send the command:
SENDBACK INDEX. This will send you the following file as an e-mail
message:
 
      Item #   Date   Time  Recs   Subject
      ------   ----   ----  ----   -------
      000016 92/01/07 11:34    9   RE: Internet lists

      000070 92/01/16 15:20   11   FTP'ing and GET command
      and so on ....
 
If you wanted to read the e-mail message with the subject FTP'ing
and GET command, then send the command SENDBACK PRINT 0070. This
will return the original mail message to your e-mail box. If you
want to interactively search another database, start your session
by entering LDBASE listserv@address, where listserv@address is the
address of the list you are interested in searching (for example,
ldbase listserv@uottawa).
 
Interactive searching with LDBASE is interesting but unfortunately
slow and will only return files under thirty lines long directly
to you. Longer files must be sent as e-mail with the command
SENDBACK, which serves to defeat the purpose of interactive
searching. The best way to use LDBASE is by sending what are
called "batch" jobs (explained above) to the LISTSERV that holds
the logbooks in which you are interested. See the document LDBASE
MEMO for complete information on interactive and batch searching.
 
 
                     Using FTP Mail Gateways
 
For those who do are not on the Internet and do not have access to
FTP, there are two servers that will process FTP commands which
are sent as e-mail. One of these servers is called BITFTP and the
other is FTPMAIL. Either sever will retrieve any file from an
anonymous FTP server on the Internet. These FTP mail gateways are
far from perfect and will not always produce the desired results.
They work best for retrieving small to medium size text files. The
following will give you some examples of using these servers and
tell you where to get more information on how to use them.
 
*  FTPMAIL
 
The best way to explain these FTP servers is by giving you a few
tested examples to try for yourself. The following examples will
show you how to get the index, a bibliography and a binary file
from the CONTENTS Project Religious Studies archive.
 
All FTPMAIL requests must be sent to the address
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com. Leave the subject line blank and turn off
your signature file before sending the mail message. If you do not
know how to turn of your signature file, the command quit (below)
will suffice. Note that you do not need to specify login and
password, as these are already defaulted to "anonymous" and your
e-mail address. Here is an example of retrieving an FTP archive
index:
 
      connect panda1.uottawa.ca
      chdir pub/religion
      get ftp-index.txt
      quit
 
This will return an e-mail message that includes the following
notice:
 
      There are [x number of] jobs ahead of this one in our
      queue.
 
      You should expect the results to be mailed to you
      within a day or so. We try to drain the request queue
      every 30 minutes, but sometimes it fills up with
      enough junk that it takes until midnight (Pacific
      time) to clear.
 
      Note that the "reply" or "answer" command in your
      mailer will not work for this message or any other
      mail you receive from FTPMAIL. To send requests to
      FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.
      As shown in the header of this message, complaints
      should be sent to the
      ftpmail-admin@inet-gw-2.pa.dec.com address rather than
      to postmaster, since our postmaster is not responsible
      for fixing FTPMAIL problems. There is no way to delete
      this request, so be sure that it has failed before you
      resubmit it or you will receive multiple copies of
      anything you have requested.
 
      There is no way to specify that your request should be
      tried only during certain hours of the day. If you
      need a file from a time-restricted FTP server, you
      probably cannot get it via FTPMAIL.
 
If you are not sure what files are in a FTP archive, then send the
ls command, which will give you a list of all files and
subdirectories in any one directory, or send the ls -lR command,
which will return to you a "recursive" listing of all files in the
current directory and all subdirectories and their files as well.
 
      connect panda1.uottawa.ca
      chdir pub/religion
      ls
      quit
 
To get a bibliography that is in ASCII text on the CONTENTS
Project FTP fileserver, use the following as a guide:
 
      connect panda1.uottawa.ca
      chdir pub/religion
      get shaman-1.txt
      quit
 
To get a binary file, you will have to first have it encoded into
ASCII before it is mailed to you. Here is an example:
 
      connect panda1.uottawa.ca
      binary
      uuencode
      chdir pub/religion
      get unzip42.exe
      quit
 
You will need to use uudecode before trying to execute any binary
file. Remember to always scan binary files for any viruses before
and after unzipping or executing. VMS, DOS, and Macintosh versions
of uudecode, atob, compress and compact are often available
through your university's computing services, if they are not
already on your network system.
 
You can get further information about using FTPMAIL by sending the
command HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com as an e-mail message.
 
*  BITFTP -- Princeton BITNET FTP Server
 
BITFTP provides a mail interface that allows BITNET, NetNorth, and
EARN users to FTP files from sites on the Internet. For complete
instructions on how to use BITFTP, send the e-mail command HELP to
bitftp@pucc or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu. Net users on VMS systems
should send the command VMS to bitftp@pucc or
bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu to request a collection of tips provided
by BITFTP users on how to handle binary files from BITFTP on VMS
systems.
 
As with FTPMAIL, the load on BITFTP is often very heavy, and
request backlogs are often so large that it may take several days
for a file to get to you once BITFTP receives your request. If
your system allows you to send interactive messages, you can
inquire about BITFTP's backlog by sending the command TELL BITFTP
AT PUCC HOW ARE YOU?
 
Unlike FTPMAIL, BITFTP is not able to provide service to nodes
that are not directly on EARN or BITNET or NetNorth. If you are
not directly on these networks, BITFTP will tell you so. At this
point you should use FTPMAIL (above) as an alternative.
 
If BITFTP is unable to connect to the FTP node you specify, it
will send you a e-mail message after the first attempt, but will
keep trying at intervals over three days. The only additional mail
file you will receive will be when the connection is made
successfully or when BITFTP gives up after three days.
 
Here is a sample BITFTP request for the ASCII text bibliography,
Religious Studies: Selected Reference Works at the Western
Washington University Libraries (1992):
 
      FTP panda1.uottawa.ca   NETDATA
      cd pub/religion
      get reference-works-biblio.txt
      quit
 
Note that if the username is "anonymous" (it almost always is), no
password is required; BITFTP will use your userid and e-mail
address as the password.
 
Questions about BITFTP and suggestions for improvements should be
directed to Melinda Varian, maint@pucc or
maint@pucc.princeton.edu.
 
Using BITFTP or FTPMAIL to retrieve binary files, or even
Postscript files, can be more than a bit tricky (although they do
work quite well when retrieving ASCII text files). One way around
having to deal with these FTP gateways is to post a query to a
LISTSERV list asking if someone on the Internet could retrieve the
program or document for you and send it via surface mail on a
diskette. This is best used with reserve, and if you have been on
the Net for any length of time, chances are that you have acquired
a few e-mail friends who will be willing to do this for you, if
contacted directly. Always offer to repay the individual for
mailing costs and time.
 
 
               *  Find Out More About LISTSERV  *
 
If you require further help in retrieving LISTSERV files please
contact your local computing services or retrieve the following
help files: LISTSERV MEMO (intended to help non-BITNET or non-
VM/CMS users in sending commands to LISTSERV and LISTSERV lists,
highly recommended reading) from listserv@bitnic and BITNET
USERHELP from listserv@marist and LISTSERV BASICS from the HELP-
NET LISTSERV fileserver at listserv@templevm or
listserv@vm.temple.edu. These are very helpful and informative
introductory files. Another useful document that explains BITNET
and LISTSERV is file HOSTINFO NOTES from listserv@jhuvm or
listserv@jhuvm.hcf.jhu.edu. This document contains a bibliography
of other useful references. These documents may also be available
at your own site.
 
 
                  Retrieving Documents via FTP
 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is what those who have access to the
Internet use to transfer files from one computer to another. FTP
can retrieve an electronic copy of the entire Bible from the other
side of the globe in a matter of minutes. On the Internet there
are hundreds of thousands of files and programs that reside on FTP
fileservers. To FTP a file or a program from a fileserver you need
to know the domain name of the system from which you want to
transfer a file. You also need to know the directory that the file
is in and the name of the file. In this guide a domain name is
referred to as a node. Wherever possible, nodes have been given in
numbers and letters, as some systems prefer one or the other.
Using FTP is referred to as a session. Note that only those users
on an Internet system will have FTP capability. BITNET users will
not be able to make direct use of FTP (see Using FTP Mail
Gateways, page 13).
 
FTP is quite complex (surprised?) and a complete description of
this network tool would exceed forty or so pages. In stead of
overwhelming you with everything-about-FTP this guide will simply
tell you what you need to know to perform basic tasks such as
FTPing to a node (Internet accessible computer), changing
directories and retrieving low ASCII text files, compressed
documents, and binary programs. If you imagine the Net as a
building full of filing cabinets, then using FTP is like going to
a particular filing cabinet (a node), opening one drawer
(directory) at a time, searching through the files in the drawer
and taking home one or more of these files (documents, programs,
sound recordings, photographs, graphic images, entire books,
almost anything). FTP can be that simple. As with all Net tools,
it is impossible for you to break anything while using FTP, and no
one will ever know if you make a few mistakes trying out something
new.
 
It is important that your FTP sessions be restricted to after the
normal business hours of the site that you are FTPing to (if you
are able to determine where that site is located). This is done to
reduce the load on FTP sites during peak local times. Failure to
observe this FTP etiquette has resulted in FTP access to certain
sites being discontinued, due to heavy use at the wrong time of
day. Remember that local business hours of a distant site may be
different from your own clock, due to different time zones.
 
*  Using FTP
 
FTP sessions have three basic stages; connecting to a remote host
(computer), changing to the desired directory and retrieving
files. Note that FTP software varies slightly throughout the Net.
If the following instructions prove unhelpful, enter the command
HELP or ? for more information once you have started your FTP
session. This guide cannot give precise details on how to start
your FTP session, due to the wide variation in systems throughout
the Net. In most cases you start a session simply by entering ftp
node.address at your system prompt. Remember to consult local
system manuals and support staff if more direction is needed.
 
When a file is available via FTP the Electric Mystic's Guide will
give the full name of the file, its node address, the directory
the file is found in and the name of the FTP file itself. The
following example provides information on the electronic text of
the Bible.
 
 The Bible (King James Version). Available as the files
      bible10.zip and bible10.txt from the Project Gutenberg
      archives via FTP from the node mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu
      (128.174.201.12) in the /extext/etext92/ directory.
 
The node address is mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu (128.174.201.12). Both
the letter address and number address is given, as some systems
prefer one or the other.
 
The directory is /extext/etext92/. Note that unlike the backslash
" \ " used by MSDOS, FTP uses a frontslash " / ", familiar to
those who use UNIX.
 
The file names are bible10.zip and bible10.txt.
 
With these pieces of information a users may then retrieve the
file to his or her own local e-mail account.
 
*  Connecting to a Host (Node)
 
A host generally refers to any computer that can be accessed from
either a local terminal or a remote computer. Hosts are also
referred to as network servers or mainframes. A host will have one
or more network addresses called nodes. Nodes are how computers on
the Net tell each other where they are located and how to find
them. Node addresses take the form of a series of either letters
or numbers, separated by periods, such as mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu or
(128.174.201.12). Note that the brackets ( ) are not part of the
node address. Think of a host like a store and the node as the
store address. Here is an sample session of FTPing to the CONTENTS
Project archive. Start by entering:
 
      FTP panda1.uottawa.ca
 
This command returns the following:
 
      VM TCP/IP FTP V2R2
      Connecting to panda1.uottawa.ca 137.122.6.16, port 21
      220 panda1 FTP server (SunOS 4.1) ready.
      USER (identify yourself to the host):
 
To which you answer by typing:  anonymous. Note that login names
are case sensitive, and anonymous is always lower case, unless
otherwise specified. Now you will see the following message:
 
      >>>USER anonymous
      331 Guest login ok, send ident as password.
      Password:
 
By "ident" is meant your full e-mail address. Sometimes FTP
sessions will require you to enter guest as a password. FTP will
usually tell you what is required. The CONTENTS Project archives
are in the directory /pub/religion/. On some systems you can now
type cd pub/religion but on others you must type cd pub then cd
religion. If one way fails, then try the other way. Note that on
the vast majority of systems, directory and file names are case
sensitive. They must be typed exactly as they appear.
 
The command cd means "change directory". Once you have moved to
the desired directory, enter the command ls to see what files are
archive there. If you enter the command list or dir, this will
give you file names, as well as their size (in bytes) and the date
they were archived. This can be important if you have limited disk
space.
 
Now you are ready to FTP any low ASCII text files. These files
usually have the extension .txt or .text and if there is no
extension, then the file is probably a low ASCII file. ASCII files
include texts, program source codes, electronic mail messages,
UNIX shell archives, uuencoded files and Postscript files. Note
that binhexed Macintosh files will have the extension .hqx and
must be treated as ASCII files.
 
At this point you could FTP the file muslim_biblio.txt to see how
things work. This is done by entering the command get
muslim_biblio.txt. When the transfer is complete, simply type
QUIT, CLOSE or BYE to return to your own site and e-mail account.
The file muslim_biblio.txt also exists as a nicely formatted
Postscript file, under the name of muslim_biblio.ps. Postscript
files are ASCII, not binary files. Here is what the FTP session
for retrieving this Postscript file looks like:
 
Ready;                        system prompt of CM/VMS site
FTP panda1.uottawa.ca         start your session
VM TCP/IP FTP V2R2
Connecting to panda1.uottawa.ca 137.122.6.16, port 21
220 panda1 FTP server (SunOS 4.1) ready.
USER (identify yourself to the host):
anonymous                     login (user) name is anonymous
>>>USER anonymous
331 Guest login ok, send ident as password.
Password:                     here you type your e-mail address
>>>PASS ********
230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
Command:
cd pub/religion               changed to the desired directory
>>>CWD pub/religion
250 CWD command successful.
Command:
get muslim_biblio.ps          retrieve desired file
>>>PORT 137,122,6,6,40,79
200 PORT command successful.
>>>RETR muslim_biblio.ps
150 ASCII data connection for muslim_biblio.ps (137.122.6.6,10319)
168237 bytes)**
226 ASCII Transfer complete.
170314 bytes transferred. Transfer rate 56.21 Kbytes/sec.**
Command:
quit                          finish your session
>>>QUIT
221 Goodbye.
Ready;
 
**Note that after each transfer, FTP tells you what files was
transferred, how big it was, and how fast it was sent to you. The
numbers down the right side are meaningless and safely ignored.
 
If you are not sure if the file you want is in ASCII or binary or
some other format, the UNIX command file will tell you what format
a file is in. While in your FTP session, enter the command file
filename (for example, file muslim_biblio.ps) to find out about
the file in question. (This command is not always available).
 
*  FTPing Binary Files
 
If you are retrieving a file that has the extensions .exe  .Z
.zip then you must use the binary mode. Type binary in your
session before issuing the get command. Binary .exe files often
have README files archived with them that provide retrieval and
installation instructions. The extension .Z is generally reserved
for UNIX compressed files. These files must be retrieved as binary
files and uncompressed on a UNIX machine. It is possible to
uncompress .Z files on IBM and Macintosh systems, your
university's computing services should have utilities available
for this (see Uncompressing Files, page 22). The extension .zip
(sometime .ZIP) denotes a binary file that has been compressed
using PKZIP or similar utility. These files can be software
programs, wordprocessor files, hypertext programs or otherwise.
After retrieving them, you will need to copy these files to your
personal computer and unzip with a PKUNZIP utility. To switch back
to ASCII mode, simply enter the command ascii.
 
As it can be a royal pain in the neck to fiddle with binary and
compressed files (particularly if you are not on a UNIX operating
system), many text files appear on the Net in two or more formats;
ASCII text, Postscript, wordprocessor, TEX and so on. This guide
has attempted to indicate whenever an ASCII version is available.
 
*  Various Common FTP Commands and Their Use
 
There is over 70 commands available on most FTP implementations,
the following are the commands you will use most often. Note that
not all commands will work at every FTP site.
 
ascii
      ASCII is the default setting for FTP, use this command
      to return to ascii mode after retrieving a binary
      file.
 
 binary
      Will switch your session to binary mode. Use this
      command before retrieving binary programs (.exe),
      zipped files (.zip), or compressed files (.Z).
 
cd directory-name
      Will move you into the directory indicated by
      directory-name.
 
cd .. or chdirup
      Will move you one sub-directory up the directory
      chain.
 
 
get file.name
      Will retrieve a file into your local e-mail account.
 
hash
      Tells FTP to send a # to you screen for every 1K it
      has transmitted. This allows you to monitor the
      transfer, but is not often necessary, as many FTP
      sites will return a current byte count while the
      transfer is in progress.
 
help command
      This will usually tell you a bit about the command in
      question.
 
list or dir
      This lists all files in the current directory, along
      with there size in bytes and the date they were
      archived.
 
ls
      Will list all files in the current directory.
 
ls -lR
      Will list all files, directories and subdirectories at
      the FTP site. This can generate a very, very long
      report, so use with caution.
 
 mget *.*
      Will retrieve all of the files in the current
      directory into your e-mail account. Use this command
      with caution as it may result in exceeding your
      available account disk space. You may have to answer
      yes or y before each file is transmitted.
 
prompt
      Tells FTP to prompt you before transferring each file
      when used with mget. It the FTP site is already set to
      prompt, then typing prompt will turn this feature off.
 
pwd
      Reveals the full name of the current directory and
      subdirectory(s).
 
*  FTP Tips
 
* Read the README, READ_ME, ReadMe, files - they usually contain
important and helpful information. Also look out for INDEX or 00-
index files - these will contain an index of the available files
in the current directory, or sometimes the entire archive.
 
* The directory pub will be the most common primary subdirectory
(it is short form for public), and is a good place to start, when
hunting around FTP archives.
 
* Some systems will prompt you with the word OPEN, to this you
respond with the FTP node address, for example, OPEN
panda1.uottawa.ca. Sometimes you will also see the prompt USER,
this requires the response anonymous.
 
* If you want to read a file before retrieving it, you can do this
only with text files that are not compressed, with the following
commands:
 
get filename.txt tt:          (from VMS)
get filename.txt -            or
get filename.txt |more        (from UNIX)
 
This should not be overused, as it ties up sites with heavy
traffic and is rude to other users waiting to login.
 
* VMS FTP directory syntax and commands are slightly different
from UNIX syntax. If you see a directory name such as
[FILESERV.DOC.DISK1], then use cdup or cd -  to ascend the tree.
If you descend only one level at a time,  you may type just the
name of the directory. Note that VMS uses square brackets [ ] as
opposed to the UNIX backslash.
 
Other VMS FTP Commands:
 
cd [.doc.disk1]   moves you down to [FILESERV.DOC.DISK1]
cd doc            moves you down to [FILESERV.DOC]
cd disk1          moves you down to [FILESERV.DOC.DISK1]
cd [-.disk2]      moves across to [FILESERV.DOC.DISK2]
cdup or cd -      moves up to [FILESERV.DOC]
cd disk2          goes down to [FILESERV.DOC.DISK2]
cd [fileserv]     takes you immediately to the root
                  [FILESERV], from your current subdirectory
 
*  Common FTP Problems
 
* On some non-UNIX based systems, you will have to rename the file
you are retrieving, if it has a long name or unusual extensions.
If the file you want to get refused to transfer, try giving it a
new, shorter name. For example, get astrology-and-judaism-
biblio.txt astro.txt. This will send the file to you as astro.txt.
 
* If you misspell anonymous when starting a FTP session, you will
get the reply "Login incorrect". You can start again by entering
user anonymous.
 
Please note that the Electric Mystic's Guide is not meant to tell
you how to use your local mailing system. There are simply too
many different systems and different sets of commands. This is why
it is important for the new networker to take local courses in
electronic mail and obtain e-mail manuals intended for local
users. These steps will save you considerable time and
frustration.
 
                       Uncompressing Files
 
File compression is the ugly side of the Net. There are many
different compression programs floating around out there, but the
ones you will come across in the Electric Mystic's Guide are
rather straightforward (.zip .hqx .Z and .tar are the most
common). The following will help you identify these extensions and
give information on how to uncompress them. The best source of
information on compression programs and file handling is the
document, Guide to File Compression, Archiving and Test Binary
Formats, (David Lemson, lemson@uiuc.edu), available as the file
compression via FTP to the node ftp.cso.uiuc.edu (128.174.5.59) in
the /doc/pcnet/ directory. This document lists most compression
programs, the programs needed to uncompress each one (for DOS,
Macintosh, UNIX, VM/CMS, Amiga, VMS, Apple 2, Atari, OS/2, and
Windows3 operating systems), and where these programs may be found
on the Net.
 
*  Common Compression Formats and Their Uncompression Programs
 
Note that the extensions are sometimes capitalized.
 
.arc    Uncompressed with arc602.exe (DOS), ArcMac1.3c (Mac),
  arc521 (UNIX), arcutil2 (VM/CMS).
 
.exe    Not a compressed file - this is a binary program that
  may be self extracting.
 
.hqx    Macintosh BinHexed file (treat as ASCII). Uncompressed
  with xbin23.zip (DOS),  BinHex4.0 (Mac), mcvert
  (UNIX), binhex (VM/CMS). BinHexed files can be
  UnBinHexed with BinHex 4.0 or Stuffit. BinHex5.0
  format is a MacBinary format, while BinHex 4.0 files
  are ASCII format.
 
.sit    Macintosh Stuffit format. Uncompressed with
  unsit30.zip (DOS), StuffItLite (Mac), unsit (UNIX),
  not available (VM/CMS).
 
.tar    UNIX program for compressing many files into one for
  quick transfer. Tar files are often in compressed
  format and look like this tar.Z (treat as binary).
  Uncompressed with tar.zip or tarread.arc or
  extar10.zip or ltarv1.zip (DOS), UnTar2.0 (Mac), on
  UNIX you need to use to commands: uncompress
  filname.tar.Z and then tar xf filename.tar (UNIX), not
  available (VM/CMS).
 
.ps     Not a compressed file - this is an ASCII Postscript
  file for printing on laser printers.
 
.uue    Uuencoded (treat as ASCII). Uncompressed with
  toaduu20.zip (DOS), uutool2.0.3 (Mac), uudecode
  (UNIX), arcutil (VM/CMS).
 
.Z      UNIX compressed file (treat as binary). Uncompressed
  on UNIX systems with the command uncompress
  filename.Z. Uncompressed with u16.zip (DOS),
  MacCompress3.2 (MAC).
 
.zip    PKZIP file (treat as binary). Uncompressed with
  pkz110eu.exe or most recent version of pkunzip.exe
  (DOS), UnZip1.1 (Mac), unzip50 (UNIX), arcutil2
  (VM/CMS).
 
Retrieve David Lemson's document (above) for details on where
these programs may be obtained on the Net or contact your
computing help centre or computer supply store.
 
* Uncompressing  and Printing UNIX Compressed (.Z) Files on
Macintosh
 
UNIX compressed (.Z) files can be uncompressed with the
decompression program called MacCompress 3.2. Note that the Apple
laser printer, LaserWriter Utility, can print Postscript files
that have been uncompressed with MacCompress 3.2.
 
* Retrieving and Using Graphic (Picture) Files
 
See the following document for complete details on handling
graphic files. The Internet contains thousands of pictures that
can be downloaded and displayed on your computer screen. These
pictures cover all subjects, and also include a number of
uncovered subjects.

downloaded as binary files and unzipped with a utility such as
PKUNZIP. They are highly recommended for both beginner and
intermediate networkers.

                            Hytelnet
 
Hytelnet is a memory resident utility (IBM/DOS) that provides
instant information on all Internet-accessible library catalogues,
Free-Nets, Campus Wide Information Servers, Gophers, Wide Area
Information Servers (WAIS), and much more. This program, written
by Peter Scott, (scott@sklib.usask.ca), is highly recommended for
the new and intermediate networker. It is available via FTP from
the node access.usask.ca in the /pub/hytelnet/pc/ directory as the
file hytelnxx.zip where xx is the number of the latest version.
 
This program has been archived using a ZIP utility. To unarchive
it, you must have a UNZIP utility. If you do not have such a
utility, one can be retrieved from the same directory as above
with the command,
 
  get pkunzip.exe
 
Note:  The unzipped files total over 600,000 bytes. It is possible
to edit out any information that is not needed once the program is
unzipped. Once you have the program on your personal computer,
create a directory called HYTELNET (mkdir c:\hytelnet) and copy
the program and the unzip utility to that directory. Then enter
pkunzip hytelnxx (where xx is the number of the version you
retrieved). This will unarchive two files, hytelnxx.zip and
READNOW.!!!. Read the file READNOW.!!! for detailed insrtuctions
for unarchiving. The program may now be unarchived with the
command pkunzip -d hytelnxx (the -d parameter is essential to
create all zipped subdirectories. To use Hytelnet, refer to the
instructions included with the program.
 
For more information on the Hytelnet program, retrieve the
LISTSERV document, Using Hytelnet to Access Internet Resources
(Peter Scott, 1992), by sending the command GET SCOTT PRV3N4 to
listserv@uhupvm1 or listserv@uhupvm1.uh.edu.
 
          * Reading Hytelnet Via Telnet While Online  *
 
There is a UNIX and VMS version of Hytelnet that is available for
browsing by Telnet. This Telnet version is well worth exploring
and saves the new user the trouble of FTPing, copying to a
personal computer, unzipping and installing the program. Internet
users can explore the online HYTELNET as follows:
 
        Telnet to access.usask.ca
        Login as hytelnet (lower case)
 
If you have access to Telnet, check this out and use it to impress
your friends.

FTP, and Telnet sessions, and a glossary. The Tour is intended to
be a fun and easy way to learn about the Internet.
 
Tour of the Internet is a HyperCard (TM) 2 stack for Macintosh
computers. In order to run this stack, you need to have HyperCard
2. HyperCard 2 requires Macintosh system 6.0.5 or higher.  Tour of
the Internet files have been compressed and saved as a StuffIt
1.5.1 archive, and converted to binhex format. In order to use the
files, you need to reverse the process. To do this, you need the
Macintosh application StuffIt 1.5.1 or StuffIt Classic. The files
take up about 760k when converted to their original format.

  *  FYI -- Network Information Services Announcements List  *
 
CERFnet has announced the establishment of a new mailing list to
serve network information service providers and end users. In a
nutshell, the nis@cerf.net list will be a group effort (in true
Internet style) to concentrate network information services (nis)
announcements onto one list for everyone's use. A few dozen
individuals around the Internet will each be monitoring a specific
source (such as mailing lists or newsgroups) and sending the
information to CERFnet. We will serve as the moderator, forwarding
pertinent submissions to the entire readership of the list,
omitting duplicates.
 
In this way, individuals can receive regular network information
even if they choose not to read discussion lists. This should
prove especially valuable for end users in specific disciplines
who are not in the networking business, but are using the network
as tool and a resource.
 
  Advantages:
 
  * volume will stay low (it won't be a discussion list)
  * pointers will be provided for more info and
  discussion
  * everyone doesn't have to read every mailing list to
  stay  current
 
  What you can do:
 
  To subscribe: send mail to listserv@cerf.net with the
  following command in the body of message:
 
        subscribe your mailing address nis
 
  (Note the difference in format from other LISTSERV
  servers)
 
  * to volunteer to monitor a source: send mail to
  nis@cerf.net
 
  * to submit an item of interest for the list to the
  moderator, comments, suggestions, helpful hints, and
  so on, send mail to nis@cerf.net
 
  Contact:

        CERFnet
        calcaris@cerf.net
 
 
* A Note to Moderators, Authors and Maintainers of Networked
  Documents *
 
I suggest that to facilitate networked research, listowners, FTP
archive maintainers and authors inform me when a new document of
relevance to Religious Studies is placed on a fileserver. This
cooperation will ensure that I am able to maintain an updated
directory for the research community.
 
It is also recommended that all listowners allow for anonymous
(non-list member) access to their LISTSERV filelists. Researchers
should not have to become a member of a discussion group to
retrieve archived documents of general interest.
 
Networked texts should be made available via both FTP and
LISTSERV, so as to ensure that all systems have access to the
archived material. Whenever possible, texts that have been zipped
or compressed should also be available as a straight low ASCII
file. Many network users are unable to either unzip (.zip) or
uncompress (.Z) files, and many sites do not have FTP capability.
Archives should provide an non-profit service that will mail
networked files on a diskette to users without full access. These
recommendations will ensure that the Net is as user-friendly as
possible.
 
Finally, I also recommend that the following information be placed
on each electronic file to facilitate citation and retrieval:
 
  LISTSERV Filename
  Location (LISTSERV Address)
  FTP Filename
  FTP Location (including directory)
  Author's Address
  Date of Publication (electronic or otherwise)
 
 
                *  FYI -- Star Trek Archive  *
 
This FTP archive contains all kinds of Star Trek files, including
Postscript pictures of the Enterprise, graphic files, quotes from
the series, and other Star Trek trivia. This archive does not
contain new material, but is a collection of other material from
throughout the Net, gathered together for one-stop-ftping. See the
directory /pub/TV/ for TV episode guides. Access: FTP to
coe.montana.edu directory: /pub/STARTREK/

  The Net is a fast growing and dynamic environment,
  which makes documenting existing resources a ongoing
  process. All documented resources, archives, and tools
  were verified before being entered in this guide, but
  this does not mean that they will still work or be
  available next week or next year. If you have trouble
  accessing a resource, please make use of the contact
  address provided (if available) and, failing this, try
  querying help-net@templevm or help-net@vm.temple.edu.
  I am not always free to directly answer every query
  that comes to my e-mail box and therefore encourage
  readers to make use of available Net help forums when
  a problem arises. See the section Getting Help (Volume
  Two) for more on how to get more information about the
  Net.

                     * 1.   Anthropology *
__________________________________________________________________
 
With the growth of multi-disciplinary studies and the social
scientific study of religion, the discipline of anthropology is
becoming increasingly important to the study of religion.
Anthropology papers and bibliographies can be found at the
following FTP archives:

          * 2.   Articles and Prepublication Papers *
__________________________________________________________________
 
Perhaps the most significant feature of the global academic
computer network is its emerging role as a prepublication forum.
Scholars are now able to place a draft copy of a document on the
fileserver of an online academic conference, such as ELENCHUS,
IOUDAIOS, or RELIGION, and ask interested online colleagues to
retrieve the draft document from the fileserver. This allows the
writer to quickly receive comments and suggestions from colleagues
in related fields around the globe. A growing number of the papers
documented below have subsequently been published in journals.
Networked FTP and LISTSERV fileservers also make it possible for
conference papers to be made widely available prior to the actual
conference. In light of the present crisis in serials pricing and
with the growing inability of academic presses to publish all
academic papers and manuscripts, the Net will be seen to assume
the dual role of publishing house and library in the emerging
"university without walls" of the next millennium.

    * 9.   Course Outlines, Seminar Syllabi and Glossaries *
__________________________________________________________________
 
Many professors and instructors are faced with reinventing the
wheel whenever the task of designing a new course or seminar comes
along. The Net offers the opportunity to archive thousands of
course outlines, seminar syllabi and glossaries which teachers may
retrieve and use to compare notes and efficiently construct that
elusive "perfect" course. International, collective and free
sharing of such pedagogical resources is ideally facilitated by
the global academic computer networks. Contact the director of the
CONTENTS Project (441495@acadvm1.uottawa.ca or 441495@uottawa) if
you have pedagogical material that you would like to make freely
available to your networked colleagues. Also remember that when
looking for course textbooks, a quick query to an appropriate
online academic conference such as RELIGION, ELENCHUS, IOUDAIOS,
FEMREL-L, or any of the dozens listed in Volume Two will yield
many helpful suggestions.
 
There is a Gopher database of course materials for University of
Pennsylvania Humanities (Classical and Religious Studies) courses
available at ccat.sas.upenn.edu. This database is an excellent
example of what we can expect to see much more of in the near
future.
 
Please note that the LISTSERV list RELIGION will only allow
subscribers access to its files. Subsciption is open to all by
sending the command SUBSCRIBE RELIGION your name to

M.H. Shakir's translation of the Koran is available as 114
individual ASCII text chapters from the node quake.think.com
(192.31.181.1) in the directory /pub/etext/koran/ (note that when
there are many files to be retrieved via FTP, use the command mget
*.* to retrieve all files in the current directory. Ensure that
you have sufficient disk space available on your e-mail account
before using the command mget to retrieve a large amount of data.)
It is also available from the nodes princeton.edu
snake.mcs.kent.edu  mcs.kent.edu  hydra.unm.edu. The Koran and a
related dictionary is also available as koran-dict.Z and koran.Z
from the node oes.orst.edu (128.193.124.2) in the
/pub/almanac/etext/ directory. This version contains a few
typographical errors which are delineated in the file on-line-
quran available from the node cs.dal.ca (129.173.4.5) in the
/pub/comp.archives/soc.religion.islam/ directory.
 
Note that retrieving the Quran in 114 separate files is only one
step in creating one's own electronic Quran for searching. Apart
from the titles of each file, there are no headings (thus no real
identifications) for the individual surahs (chapters). So one must
intersperse the file headers with the file contents to recreate a
useful consecutive text.

format. These files can be played back using SoundMaster or other
Macintosh sound utilities. Presently available files include the
Islamic call to prayer, and a recitation of the first surah of the
Koran.

__________________________________________________________________
 
A supplement to the CONTENTS Project (see Volume Two), Lists in
Review, provides an overview of many of the LISTSERV lists (online
academic conferences) of relevance to Religious Studies. A team of
editors surveys individual online academic conferences and records
lists of subject keywords that will serve to indicate what has
been discussed on any given online conference. These list
summaries are compiled by the supplement editor, posted to the
CONTENTS Project and archived on a LISTSERV and FTP fileserver.
This collection will allow networked researchers to quickly survey
what has been discussed on dozens of Religious Studies lists and
then retrieve past conversations from a list's logbook.
 
If you would like to collect topic keywords from your favourite
LISTSERV list for Lists in Review, please contact the LIR editor,
Michael T. Bradley, Jr. at mtb3@cunixf or
mtb3@cunixf.cc.columbia.edu.

RELIGION is a LISTSERV list for the scholarly discussion of
religions. It is sponsored by the Harvard Center for the Study of
World Religions. Unlike lists with similar names, RELIGION does
not deal with matters of personal faith or theology. Rather, it's
aim is to encourage discussion of the historical and comparative
study and teaching of religions. Relevant approaches include
history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, literary criticism,
and anthropology. Relevant issues include methodology in the study
and teaching of religions; comparative themes such as myth,
ritual, mysticism, community, and inter-religious contact; and
issues specific to particular traditions.

          * 19.  Sacred and Primary Electronic Texts  *
__________________________________________________________________
 
The following is a listing of all electronic, network-accessible
sacred texts and primary texts of scholarly (or religious)
interest that may be freely retrieved via FTP or LISTSERV. The
Bible, the Book of Mormon and the Koran (also spelled Quran) are
available at many sites and in a variety of formats, such as
ASCII, zipped (.zip), compressed (.Z) and archived (.arc). The
following section indicates where low ASCII versions of these
sacred texts may be found on selected sites. For related programs
see the section Software Programs for Religious Studies (page 94).
This section also provides information on networked electronic
versions of primary texts that are of use to the academic
community. Note that the CCAT Gopher (ccat.sas.upenn.edu) is
quickly developing into a major index and database of Religious
Studies primary and secondary texts. This Gopher should be
consulted for current information.
 
*  The Bible (King James Version)
 
Available as the files bible10.zip and bible10.txt from the
Project Gutenberg archives via FTP from the node
mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu (128.174.201.12) in the /extext/etext92/
directory. Note that the available KJV bibles on the Net do not
include the apocrypha.
 
Nicene Creed. Various versions, English text (1991).
  Available from ORTHODOX, listserv@indycms as CREED
  ENGLISH1 and CREED ENGLISH2.
 
*  The Book of Mormon
 
Available as the files mormon13.txt and mormon13.zip from the
Project Gutenberg archives via FTP from the node
mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu (128.174.201.12) in the /extext/etext91/
directory.
 
*  Other  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon
Church) Materials:
 
Doctrine and Covenants. Available as the file d-and-c.zip
  via FTP from oak.oakland.edu in the /pub/msdos/mormon/
  directory.
 
Pearl of Great Price. Available as pofgp.zip via FTP from
  oak.oakland.edu in the /pub/msdos/mormon/ directory.
 
*  The Koran (Quran)
 
M.H. Shakir's translation of the Koran is available as 114
individual ASCII text chapters from the node quake.think.com
(192.31.181.1) in the /pub/etext/koran/ directory (note that when
there are many files to be retrieved via FTP, use the command mget
*.* to retrieve all files in the current directory. Ensure that
you have sufficient disk space available on your e-mail account
before using the command mget to retrieve a large amount of data.)
It is also available from the nodes princeton.edu
snake.mcs.kent.edu   mcs.kent.edu   hydra.unm.edu. The Koran and a
related dictionary is also available as koran-dict.Z and koran.Z
from the node oes.orst.edu (128.193.124.2) in the
/pub/almanac/etext/ directory. This version contains a few
typographical errors which are delineated in the file on-line-
quran available from the node cs.dal.ca (129.173.4.5) in the
/pub/comp.archives/soc.religion.islam/ directory.
 
Note that retrieving the Quran in 114 separate files is only one
step in creating one's own electronic Quran for searching. Apart
from the titles of each file, there are no headings (thus no real
identifications) for the individual surahs (chapters). So one must
intersperse the file headers with the file contents to recreate a
useful consecutive text.
 
A short file of various quotes from the Koran is also available
via LISTSERV from listserv@asuacad.bitnet or listserv@asuacad as
PAKISTAN AL_QURAN.
 
*  Other Islamic Studies Materials:
 
American Arab Scientific Society (AMASS) Software Library at

*  Searching for Online Sacred Texts with Archie
 
The sacred texts listed above are available via FTP through many
different hosts around the world. If the above locations are
difficult to reach from your location you can find alternative
locations by using an Archie server. Telnet to the nearest Archie
server and login as archie. To conduct a search type prog keyword
where keyword is the name of the desired text. Some appropriate
keywords are bible, koran, quran, mormon, and tanach. If your site
does not allow for Telnet sessions it is possible to search Archie
by sending e-mail messages to the nearest server.
 
Information on how to use Archie can be obtained by sending the
command HELP as an e-mail message to archie@archie.mcgill.ca (or
archie@any.node.below). Other helpful documents are What is
Archie? (Richard Hintz, 1991), available via FTP as the file
archie_guide.txt from the node hydra.uwo.ca in the directory
/libsoft/ and the document Internet Archie Server Listing Service:
A Reference Manual, (R.P.C. Rodgers, 1991),  available via FTP as
the file archieuser.gde from the node infolib.murdoch.edu.au in
the /pub/soft/archie/ directory. There is also available Peter
Deutsch's document, Archie - An Electronic Directory Service for
the Internet, which can be retrieved as the file whatis.archie via
FTP from the node ftp.sura.net in the /pub/nic/archie/docs/
directory. For detailed user instructions, see also the file
archie.man.txt in the same directory.
 
Archie will provide user information if you type the command help.
It is possible to have your Telnet session search results mailed
to you by typing the command mail your@address which causes the
output of the last command to be mailed to the specified address
or comma-separated list of addresses (replace your@address with
your e-mail address. All the various Internet addressing styles
are understood. BITNET sites should use the convention
user@sitename.bitnet). If you use the command set mailto
your@address before conducting any searches with the prog command,
then the output of any search will be mailed to you upon entering
the command mail. This is very useful if you intend to conduct a
number of searches in one session.

                 *  FYI -- The World Wide Web  *
 
The WorldWideWeb (W3) is a wide-area hypermedia information
retrieval  initiative that intends to provide universal access to
Internet documents. Documents and databases are cross-referenced
by hypertext-like links. It is well worth your time to explore
this emerging system. The WoldWideWeb will eventually provide a
master index to major Internet douments and archives.
 
The following are some of the subject areas currently covered;
Aeronautics; Astronomy and Astrophysics; Bio Sciences; Computing;
Geography; Law; Libraries; Lists of online catalogues; Literature;
Humanities; Mathematics; Meteorology; Music; Physics; Politics;
Reference; Religion; and Social Sciences.
 
The WorldWideWeb allows for searching by keyword, subject and
system (WAIS, FTP, Gopher, Telnet and so on).

        * 21.  Software Programs for Religious Studies *
__________________________________________________________________
 
There are countless thousands of programs freely available over
the networks that are of use to those in Religious Studies. While
it would be an almost impossible task to document every existing
program, it is nonetheless possible to indicate where the more
valuable archives exits and how to search these archives for
Religious Studies related software.
 
Most software archives follow a standard pattern with directories
entitled msdos, macintosh, and unix. When in a FTP archive, start
by finding the appropriate directory for your operating system.
Subdirectories to watch out for are usually titled bible, books,
hebrew, islam, israel, and religion. Remember to type binary
before FTPing a .zip or .exe file.
 
 
*  Primary Software Archives
 
The following are two FTP archives that contain thousands of
general software programs and some Religious Studies related
software.
 
FTP Address         Directories
 
israel.nysernet.org /israel/
 
  Retrieve the file Index.israel.Z for a complete
  listing. For more information, see the section The
  Israel Project at Nysernet (Electric Mystic's Guide,
  Volume Two).
 
oak.oakland.edu     /pub/bible/
              /pub/msdos/hebrew/
              /pub/msdos/mormon/
              /pub/msdos/notabene/
 
For more information, see the section The Oak Software Repository
(Electric Mystic's Guide, Volume Two).
 
Other major software archives are located at:
 
ftp.uu.net
archive.umich.edu
 
Be careful when retrieving indexes from these archives. Sometimes
a master index of all files can exceed five million bytes in size.
Always check the README files for helpful information. UNIX users
can use the command get filename |more to read the contents of an
ASCII text file, such as an index or a readme file. This command
does not actually retrieve the file to your account, so you do not
have to be concerned with file size when using it.
 
 
                 *  Graphic Files from Israel  *
 
The following is an index of graphic files available from the node
israel.nysernet.org in the /israel/graphics/ directory.
